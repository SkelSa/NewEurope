Currently, there are only a handful of options though this might change in the future. Most settings have a tooltip when you hover with the mouse over them in addition to the event descriptions so there should be no problem to know what each one does.\nIt's recommended to check out the following settings as they will be permanent throughout your game and could make your playthrough more enjoyable..."

Every former SSR will remain a puppet of the RFSFR though and a new faction will be founded to replace the Comintern. Mongolia and Tannu Tuva will only get a guarantee from Russia.\n\n"Additional Research Slot for all Majors" - > Every country which is considered to be a major by this game (Germany, Italy, France, UK, Soviet Union, United States, China and Japan)will get an additional research slot from the start. This will allow some countries to conduct better historical research but also leads to a 7 research slot USA. It's recommended to be enabled when playing with technology tree overhauls.\n"The Old Manager" - > You can ignore this for now\n"Enable Music for specific Events" - > Music will be played when a specific event in world history, like the start of the Sino-Japanese War, happens in your game. Currently, only a few events support this but more are definitely planned...\nAlso, hover over the buttons to see which option is enabled right now."

 ##OPTIONS: Flags and names 
 ne_settings.1.t:0 "BPWE: Historical Flavour"
 ne_settings.1.d:0 "The historical settings aim to provide realistic and hsitorical flags, names and leaders. Through this event you can activate the historical accurate flags, country names and sometimes the color of several countries. In total around 25 countries will see a change, the most important ones will be Germany and Japan. Additionally, flag changes which happened historically between 1936 and 1948 will also happen via event.\nThe "Better Leaders" option will replace some head of states to more historical ones. For example, Boleslaw Bierut will now lead a Communist Poland.\nThe last option allows you to to change the communist names of the 14 Soviet Republics to end with SSR (Soviet Socialist Republic) either with their standard color or a reddish tone similar to that of the motherland. Just hover over the buttons to see a the full list of changes!"

 ##OPTIONS: USA and USSR Names
 ne_settings.2.t:0 "BPWE: Names of the USSR and USA"
 ne_settings.2.d:0 "Due to the indecisiveness of this mod's creator towards country names, you can now choose the country names for the USA and USSR. Hover over the buttons to see what each button does. Keep in mind that the long country names may overlap in news events, while the short versions can look weird on the political map.\nSo it's your choice!"
 ne_settings.2.a:0 "Choose abbreviations!"

 ne_settings.2.c:0 "Keep vanilla!"
 ne_settings.2.c1:0 "Return to the main menu"
 ne_settings.2.e:0 "Revert to vanilla!"
 
 ##OPTIONS: Neutrality settings
 ne_settings.3.t:0 "BPWE: Force some contries to stay neutral"
 ne_settings.3.d:0 "Currently in most games, neutral nations like Sinkiang, Switzerland or Turkey have no difficulties joining a faction even in historical mode once the world tension is high enough. This leads to unhistorical and unrealistic scenarios and usually screws up the flow of World War II.\nThe following option will give some nations like for instance Switzerland, Sweden or Turkey a neutrality spirit to avoid any faction joining during the war. The spirits will be removed should any country be dragged into a defensive conflict however.\nSpain is also handled via this though their neutrality is handled via events and world situation."
 ne_settings.3.a:0 "Make some countries neutral!"
 ne_settings.3.b:0 "I don't want these changes anymore!"
 ne_settings.3.c:0 "Return"
 
 ##OPTIONS: Faction Settings 
 ne_settings.4.t:0 "BPWE: Factions"
 ne_settings.4.d:0 "With the options below you can enable stricter join rules for NATO or the Warsaw Pact.\nThe stricter rules for NATO/WP are obviously only applied once NATO or the Warsaw pact are created and mean that not every democratic country can join NATO, for instance, instantly. Instead, they would have to achieve a lot of party popularity. Several national spirits help you to see when a country would be ready to join. If they are a great power, Players can invite some countries earlier into their faction via the diplomacy slots while any AI-only faction requires any potential new members to have a really high party popularity among some other minor conditions. Historical invitations are done via event however.\nChoose now what you want."
 ne_settings.4.a:0 "Enable historical NATO/PACT"
