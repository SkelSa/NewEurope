 ne_news.1.t:0 "Better Post-War Europe"
 ne_news.1.d:0 "Hi and thanks for subscribing to my mod. BPWE enhances and guarantees a more realistic Europe in a somehow historical playthrough. Besides some fixes like flags and names, this mod also adds around 30 various states so you can recreate the borders of Europe after the Nazi defeat. \n Additionally I've included several events to correct any bordergore and some other tweaks. All events are now dynamic and will trigger without any issues during a somehow historical playthrough.Also the mighty post-war manager is optional and you can always click them away and let horrible borders haunt you. \n And now have fun, I've already talked too much..."
 ne_news.1.a:0 "Thanks for the info!"
 
 ##PRC-PROCLAMATION##
 ne_news.2.t:0 "The Proclamation of the PRC"
 ne_news.2.d:0 "Today Mao Zedong, Chairman of the PRC, announced the official founding of the People's Republic of China. After several years of heavy fighting against the Kuomintang and the horrible Second Sino-Japanese War, peace has finally returned to the nation and rebuilding is now in progress. While millions of families bury their dead loved ones, Chairman Mao has promised his people a prosperous future and a new era for China, with the principles of equality, justice and socialism.\n While this development will surely influence the politics of China's neighbours, it's still a question how and where Mao Zedong will lead his nation. "
 ne_news.2.a:0 "After decades, China has been united again!"
 ne_news.2.b:0 "We have to intervene or Asia will be red too!"
 ne_news.2.c:0 "The revolution has spread to Asia..."
 
 ##HITLER IS DEAD##
 ne_news.3.t:0 "Hitler is Dead!"
 ne_news.3.d:0 "Just now, Karl Dönitz announced in an important broadcast that the Führer, Adolf Hitler, "died defending his Vaterland" and he himself, Dönitz, is now in command of the remains of the Reich. There wasn't much information else, however it's assumed that Hitler comitted suicide in his bunker in Berlin to avoid captivity by the enemy surrounding the Reichshauptstadt. The whereabouts of the other NSDAP politicians or Eva Braun is unknown, though it is assumed they're either dead or fleeing. \n Since most of the Reich is occupied and the Wehrmacht is near collapse, the death of Hitler is probably the last nail to the coffin of German morale. "
 ne_news.3.a:0 "The 1000-year Reich will fall!"
 ne_news.3.b:0 "May he burn in hell!"
 ne_news.3.c:0 "So the bastard's dead? Too bad we didn't catch him alive!"
 ne_news.3.e:0 "We will never forget you and win this war! Ruhe in Frieden, ewiger Führer!"
 
 ##HITLER IS IN RAGE##
 ne_news.4.t:0 "Hitler is in RAGE!"
 ne_news.4.d:0 "Several reports coming from the Führerbunker indicate that the Führer went completely insane. Allegedly after he heard that Steiner couldn't conduct an offensive to relieve Berlin, Hitler became furious. Shortly afterwards the Führer accused everyone, even the German people, as cowards and traitors and broke pencils while shouting for Fegelein, who will be executed as a traitor when found. Several German generals are convinced that Adolf Hitler has really lost any contact with the reality and still commands around divisions which no longer exist. Most experts are sure that it's just a matter of time now until his Reich will collapse and the Allies find him."
 ne_news.4.a:0 "Crazy!"
 ne_news.4.b:0 "You could say he...is...Führious!"
 ne_news.4.c:0 "His days are numbered. We need to catch him!"
 ne_news.4.e:0 "This is just temporary..."
 
 ##FATE OF GERMANY##
 
 ##Germany is partitioned!
 ne_news.5.t:0 "The Occupation of Germany"
 ne_news.5.d:0 "Germany's fate was already sealed at Yalta, when [SOV.GetLeader], Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt agreed on how the "new Europe" should look like. The four victorious powers, namely the [USA.GetName], [FRA.GetName], the [SOV.GetName] and the [ENG.GetName], will get an occupation zone each, which is roughly the area they control now. During the occupation, a process called "denazification" will follow to eradicate thoughts about a revival of fascism and militarism. Eventually several trials against war criminals like Goering, Speer and other Nazi members will be held. \nCurrently it's unknown how long the occupation will last, though most people expect a new, neutral Germany in less than 5 years."
 ne_news.5.a:0 "Germany will never be the same..."
 ne_news.5.b:0 "We should have done this after the first war..."
 ne_news.5.c:0 "A bitter price for them..."
 ne_news.5.e:0 "Dark times for our nation..."
 
 ##Germany is divided!
 ne_news.6.t:0 "Germany is divided!"
 ne_news.6.d:0 "Even though the relations between the wartime allies, viz the [USA.GetName] and the [SOV.GetName], were always cold, it's now official: Germany will stay divided.\nAfter the "Federal Republic of Germany" was founded, it didn't take long for its Eastern neighbour to also emerge as an own nation. As the time will go on, both countries will slowly drift to their corresponding ideology and develop their own identity. The differences between socialism and capitalism will prevent a German reunification as long as one superpower is still standing."
 ne_news.6.a:0 "A nation divided..."
 ne_news.6.b:0 "Damn communists!"
 ne_news.6.c:0 "We were for reunification! Damn imperialists!"
 ne_news.6.e:0 "We will never be the same people again!"
 
 ##Germany is unified (Stalin Notes)!
 ne_news.7.t:0 "Stalin Note was accepted!"
 ne_news.7.d:0 "After a long series of negotiations, [USA.GetLeader] agreed on behalf of the Western powers to accept the [SOV.GetAdjective] proposal concerning the Stalin Note. The Russian proposal suggests a reunification of both German states to allow a neutral and independent Germany, which also will act as a buffer state to decrease tensions along the "Iron Curtain".\nFollowing the successful negotiations, the reunification will probably be imminent and thus the German people will no longer be apart. Additionally, Germany will never again to able to throw the world into chaos, as it's surrounded by the two most powerful blocs in history."

 ##Trotsky Notes
 ne_news.7.tt:0 "Trotsky Note was accepted, German reunification imminent!"
 ne_news.7.dt:0 "\nAfter a long series of negotiations, [USA.GetLeader] agreed on behalf of the Western powers to accept the [SOV.GetAdjective] proposal concerning the Trotsky Note.

 ne_news.7.a:0 "A victory for the German people!"
 ne_news.7.b:0 "One possible front less..."
 ne_news.7.c:0 "As long as they stay neutral..."
 ne_news.7.e:0 "Finally!"
 
 ##Germany is denied reunification! (Stalin Notes)
 ne_news.7.t1:0 "Germany remains divided"
 ne_news.7.d1:0 "To no one's surprise, the Western Allies have just rejected a unique offer from the [SOV.GetName] called the "Stalin Note". In summary, [SOV.GetLeader] offered the Western allies to finally unite the German nation, which has been split since WW2, and create a buffer zone between both power blocs. However, due to Western distrust of the Soviets, the note was eventually dismissed. [WGR.GetLeader] stated that a possible reunification is, as long as the Soviet Union still stands, unthinkable and would sooner or later, due to subversive activities by the Soviets, end in a communist Germany anyways.\nNevertheless, the topic has caused heated debates in the West. Some experts now harshly criticize this decision, claiming that an excellent chance to ease tensions towards the Soviets is now gone forever."

 ne_news.7.a1:0 "Imagine if this had succeeded..."
 ne_news.7.b1:0 "The Reds would have influenced them later anyways."
 ne_news.7.c1:0 "It was worth a try..."
 ne_news.7.e1:0 "Our people will never be one again..."
 
 ##FATE OF KOREA##
 ##Korea divided 1950
 ne_news.8.t:0 "The Division of Korea"
 ne_news.8.d:0 "After Japan was defeated, the [SOV.GetAdjective] and [USA.GetAdjective] military briefly occupied Korea, which was annexed by Japan in 1910. Since two weeks, several talks between both superpowers should define a future for the Korean peninsula and its people, but due to the frosty relation between the former allies, there has been no success.\nYesterday, a simple solution was drawn up, which suggests a division along the 38th parallel to give each nation an equal amount of territory.\nBecause of the current tensions, both parties finally agreed to split the peninsula along the 38th parallel but dismissed any ideas of a neutral, united Korea. Instead, the North and South will each get an own nation with a different ideological mindset."
 ne_news.8.a:0 "Is a division now the solution to everything?!"
 ne_news.8.b:0 "It will work."
 ne_news.8.c:0 "Better than no solution..."
 ne_news.8.e:0 "We don't want to be the game ball of foreign nations!"
 
 ##Korea divided 1953
 ne_news.9.t:0 "The Division of Korea"
 ne_news.9.d:0 "After Japan was defeated, the [SOV.GetAdjective] and [USA.GetAdjective] military briefly occupied Korea, which was annexed by Japan in 1910. Since two weeks, several talks between both superpowers should define a future for the Korean peninsula and its people, but due to the frosty relation between the former allies, there has been no success.\nYesterday, a simple solution was drawn up, which suggests a random demilitarized border along the 38th parallel to give each nation an equal amount of territory.\nBecause of the current tensions, both parties finally agreed to split the peninsula along a random border but dismissed any ideas of a neutral, united Korea. Instead, the North and South will probably each get an own nation."
 ne_news.9.a:0 "Is a division now the solution to everything?!"
 ne_news.9.b:0 "It will work."
 ne_news.9.c:0 "Better than no solution..."
 ne_news.9.e:0 "We don't want to be the game ball of foreign nations!"
 
 ##Korea remains occupied!
 ne_news.10.t:0 "Korea remains occupied!"
 ne_news.10.d:0 "After countless unsuccessful attempts to find a solution to the Korean issue, the [USA.GetName] has announced to end the meetings and keep the peninsula occupied until further notice. Several leaders around the globe have expressed their shock and spoke out sympathy for the Korean people, while condemning both superpowers. Most notably was [YUG.GetLeader], who especially criticised the lack of cooperation and compromise between the two powers and encouraged them to start new talks.\nThe future of Korea remains uncertain, though the peninsula won't be occupied forever. Possible new negotiations will happen in the distant future, most experts believe."
 ne_news.10.a:0 "What a joke!"
 ne_news.10.b:0 "You can't work together with communists!"
 ne_news.10.c:0 "Another example of Western oppression..."
 
 ##Korea is unified!
 ne_news.11.t:0 "Korea is reunified!"
 ne_news.11.d:0 "After many talks and meetings, [SOV.GetLeader] and [USA.GetLeader] eventually put aside their differences and distrust to find a solution for Korea. As both parties control the peninsula since Japan's capitulation, the time has come to grant the Koreans an own state.\nMany experts predicted the founding of two Koreas out of their respective occupation zone, but no such idea was actually considered. Instead, Korea will be an independent nation in a bipolar world and keep a distance to the US or Russia.\nWhile nobody knows if Korea's independence and neutrality won't be violated sometime, the unification may allow the "chosen peninsula" to strive and prosper."
 ne_news.11.a:0 "Let's hope for peace on the peninsula..."
 ne_news.11.b:0 "Let's hope the communists keep to the agreement..."
 ne_news.11.c:0 "As long as they stay neutral..."
 ne_news.11.e:0 "Our new nation will thank both countries!"
 
 
 ##KOREAN WAR##
 ##Korean War Start!
 ne_news.12.t:0 "War in Korea!"
 ne_news.12.d:0 "Several reports from Korea indicate gunfire and artillery explosions along the border of North and South Korea. According to the South Korean Defense Ministry, the DPRK has launched a large scale-offensive across the 38th parallel to "free their southern brothers". \nMultiple defenses were hastily constructed near the border, but most garrison troops are apparently already encircled. It's unclear if the [KOR.GetName] can stop the invasion, though the UN has already announced its support and American and British troops will arrive in some weeks. However, it remains unclear how the war on the peninsula will play out..."
 ne_news.12.a:0 "War will never end..."
 ne_news.12.b:0 "We will stop the communists and throw them back!"
 ne_news.12.c:0 "Let's hope the North Koreans are successful..."
 ne_news.12.e:0 "For Kim Il-sung!"
 ne_news.12.f:0 "We need to help the South!"
 
 ##Korean War Cease-Fire
 ne_news.13.t:0 "Temporary Truce in Korea!"
 ne_news.13.d:0 "This morning, the foreign ministers of the [DPR.GetName] and [KOR.GetName] met in Busan and signed a temporary truce between their respective countries. After many months of gruesome war, both sides are exhausted and short in men, material and morale. It is expected that both countries will use the time to their advantage and replenish their losses, develop new plans and rebuild infrastructure. All countries with volunteer forces in the region have already boarded the ships to travel home, though several Chinese, American and Soviet advisors are staying.\nNo one knows how long the peace will last, but most experts can agree on several months at least."
 ne_news.13.a:0 "How long will the truce last?"
 ne_news.13.b:0 "We have to watch them every minute!"
 ne_news.13.c:0 "Kim should use the truce to his advantage..."
 ne_news.13.e:0 "We will crush them soon enough!"
 ne_news.13.f:0 "The truce will be essential for the Republic's victory..."
 
 ##Korean War Continues
 ne_news.14.t:0 "No Cease-Fire in Korea!"
 ne_news.14.d:0 "After many failed attempts to negotiate a peace in Korea, it's now official that there won't be any kind of peace between the North and South. Even though the civilian population is suffering badly and both sides are in dire need of soldiers and equipment, [DPR.GetLeader] and [KOR.GetLeader] are convinced to continue the war at all costs, stating that a peace would only give the enemy time to reorganize.\nMost military experts expect a decisive victory in the following months by either side, though the winner will probably be weakened for several decades, as most infrastructure and cities are already flattened and in rubble."
 ne_news.14.a:0 "Idiots."
 ne_news.14.b:0 "We will never lose!"
 ne_news.14.c:0 "Let's hope it doesn't end in a World War..."
 ne_news.14.e:0 "Propaganda! We're as good as victorious!"
 ne_news.14.f:0 "Unbelievable!"
 
 ##Korean War Victory DPRK
 ne_news.15.t:0 "Korean War is over!"
 ne_news.15.d:0 "After many bloody battles, the [DPR.GetName] has finally crushed the "Busan pocket" and captured the harbor. During the last final assault, many foreign troops from multiple UN nations suffered horrendous losses and only few could escape the slaughter in the last minute.\nThe communist government has already celebrated their victory with a massive military parade. In a speech [DPR.GetLeader] later promised the Korean people a prosperous future under the guidance of Marxism and Socialism.\n One thing is for sure: The Western nations have lost an important strategic location in East Asia and [USA.GetLeader] will go down in history as the "Man, who lost Korea"."
 ne_news.15.a:0 "Korea is finally united..."
 ne_news.15.b:0 "This is a disaster!"
 ne_news.15.c:0 "Socialism knows no defeat!"
 ne_news.15.e:0 "Let's honor our fallen."
 
 ##Korean War Victory ROK
 ne_news.16.t:0 "Korean War is over!"
 ne_news.16.d:0 "After a brutal and long war, forces of the [KOR.GetName] finally stormed the encircled city of Pyongyang, crushing any communist forces left. Some small infantry batallions have retreated towards the mountains and continue the fighting as guerillas, though the situation looks grim for them.\n There's no official statement from the [SOV.GetName] or [PRC.GetName], but several sources indicate that their volunteer forces are returning home. Several weapons are allegedly smuggled across the border to support some guerillas, but the Korean government has already announced extensive anti-partisan operations.\nAccording to some foreign intelligence agencies, [KOR.GetLeader] has additionally already started massive anti-communist purges, but also locked up thousands of liberals."
 ne_news.16.a:0 "Korea is finally united..."
 ne_news.16.b:0 "In the end, freedom and democracy will always win!"
 ne_news.16.c:0 "This is a disaster!"
 ne_news.16.e:0 "Time to rebuild our country..."
 
 
 ##FOUNDING OF THE NEW BLOCS##
 ##Nato
 ne_news.17.t:0 "The Founding of NATO"
 ne_news.17.d:0 "Yesterday, several democratic nations met in Washington D.C., to discuss the founding of a new military defense alliance against the "Red Threat". Fearing a possible invasion of Western Europe, several nations seek protection from the US, as the [ENG.GetName] is still devastated by the last major war. In the end, 12 states agreed to be a member in this new Western alliance, called "NATO", to work together in a case of conflict with the [SOV.GetName].\nFollowing the founding of this new anti-communist alliance, [SOV.GetLeader] showed disinterest and merely stated, that NATO all in all is just a symbolic move by the western Allies to deter invented "Soviet aggression".\nMost experts expect an Eastern counterpart and additional members for the Western alliance, but this remains to be seen."
 ne_news.17.a:0 "The West stand determined..."
 ne_news.17.b:0 ""Defensive", sure..."
 ne_news.17.c:0 "United we stand!"
 ne_news.17.e:0 "Nothing to worry about..."
 ne_news.17.f:0 "Maybe we should apply for membership..."
 
 ##Warsaw Pact
 ne_news.18.t:0 "The Warsaw Pact is formed!"
 ne_news.18.d:0 "Unsurprisingly to most foreign experts, the USSR yesterday founded its own defensive alliance in Warsaw as a response to NATO. The "Warsaw Pact", formally the "Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance", has eight member states and spans across Central and Eastern Europe. According to [SOV.GetLeader], its goal is the "protection of socialism in Europe and deterrence of American imperialism".\nWhile most Western leaders are now concerned with the future of their country, [USA.getLeader] and [ENG.GetLeader] promised to increase their defense spending and station more troops in Europe.\nWhile a third world war would certainly destroy the planet, most experts believe that both nuclear powers will keep each other in check now."
 ne_news.18.a:0 "The world is divided..."
 ne_news.18.b:0 "Maybe we should ask for membership..."
 ne_news.18.c:0 "We had no plans to attack them anyways!"
 ne_news.18.e:0 "No one can stop us now!"
 ne_news.18.f:0 "Maybe, NOW we should join NATO..."

 ##LEASE OF PORT ARTHUR##
 ne_prc.9.t:0 "The Lease of Port Arthur/Dalian"
 ne_prc.9.d:0 "Warm water ports are very valuable for the Soviet Union as most of our ports freeze during the winter and in conclusion hinder our trade. Though we do have the Baltic ports and Königsberg now with Germany's defeat, we still lack a proper harbor in the East Asia, as Vladivostok occasionally freezes too. The Chinese under Mao control Port Arthur, which we lost in 1904 when the Japanese attacked us.\nOur communist brothers in China would surely lease us this port, right? "
 ne_prc.9.a:0 "Send a request to Mao!"

 ne_prc.13.d:0 "A foreign power occupies rightful Chinese territory and now the time has come to end colonialism once and for all.

 ne_prc.14.t:0 "The PRC wants to have Port Arthur back!"

 ne_prc.16.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
 ne_prc.16.b:0 "We have better things to do. Back down"
 
 ##SOVIETS RETURN PORT ARTHUR##
 ne_prc.17.t:0 "The Return of Port Arthur"
 ne_prc.17.d:0 "Ten years ago, we leased Port Arthur, also known as Dalian from the Chinese to relieve Vladivostok. Now the Chinese demand the return since the contract has now expired and their military demands a vital port back. We can either return it, like we promised, or keep it under military control. It would be foolish for them to attack us, but we might lose our good relationship with the CPC. "
 ne_prc.17.a:0 "A promise is a promise!"
 ne_prc.17.b:0 "Port Arthur will be Russian from now on. Forever!"
 ##Feedback China; Soviets agree
 ne_prc.18.t:0 "[From.GetName] returns Dalian!
 ne_prc.18.d:0 "After ten years of leasing, Dalian is finally again Chinese and will be for the next centuries! [From.GetName] has kept its promises from the contract and returned the harbor yesterday though several facilities, which were built during the time, were disassembled and brought back to [From.GetNameDef].\n Nevertheless the [From.GetAdjective] government proved to be trustworthy and there will surely be more trade and cooperation in the future!"
 ne_prc.18.a:0 "Dalian is ours again!"
 ##Feedback China; SOV keeps Dalian
 ne_prc.19.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects the return of Dalian!"
 ne_prc.19.d:0 "Ten years ago, we leased the vital warm water port Dalian, or Port Arthur, to [From.GetNamedef]. According to the contract we should've had control over it since the end of last month but [From.GetName]'s warships are still there and they refuse to acknowledge our agreement. It seems like our socialist neighbor has fooled us and appparently only war can settle this dispute now. Is an armed conflict between our nations really the only choice? "
 ne_prc.19.a:0 "Dalian belongs to us!"
 ne_prc.19.b:0 "We can't afford a war right now..."
 
 ##PRC DEMANDS FORMER JAPANESE TERRITORY##
 ne_prc.20.t:0 "Demanding former Japanese territories"
 ne_prc.20.d:0 "Manchukuo, Mengjiang and East Hebei were all lost during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1931. Though Japan is now defeated, other empires could take control over them during the peace treaties and now several million Chinese people are again trapped under the despotism of foreign regimes. As the one and true China, it's our job to unify all Chinese citizens under one flag.\nThe time has come to end foreign administration; let's send some written requests to get our territory back!"
 ne_prc.20.a:0 "We've waited for far too long!"

 ne.333.d:0 "Even though the Treaty of Versailles strictly prohibited a unification between Austria and Germany, Hitler simply integrated his home country just mere 20 years later. Several intelligent heads have already drawn up some plans, one even suggests to divide them like some plans for the greater brother. Which plan should be enforced?"

It's even more furious if one considers the fact that the Nazis fully exploited this properous nad booming nation to feed their own demands. Sadly it's not possible to change the past so now we need to decide very well so Czechoslovakia will stay stable... "

 ne.341.t:0 "What about Sweden?"
 ne.341.d:0 "Though the Swedish nation did not join either the Allies or Axis, they still delivered crucial iron ore to Germany and thus helped the German war machine. It's not neccessary to touch them but we could use this argument to question Swedish neutrality..."
 ne.341.a:0 "(Historical) Don't interfere"
 ne.341.b:0 "Force them to cede some territory to Norway and Denmark!"
 ne.341.c:0 "Unite Sweden with Aland!"
 ne.341.e:0 "Return to the previous menu"
 
 ne.342.t:0 "Partitioning of Switzerland?"
 ne.342.d:0 "Though the Swiss would have certainly faced a visit from the German Reich if the Allies and Soviets were gone, it would have been very bloody for the Wehrmacht. Facing guns behind every blade of grass, mountain fortresses and massive infrastructure/supply problems, "Operation Tannenbaum" would have proven to be an embarassment for the "unstoppable" Wehrmacht. Switzerland, however, survived this war and maintained their neutrality once again but maybe it would be better to partition them between Germany, France and Italy? This would be a drastic decision without a doubt..."
 ne.342.a:0 "(Historical) Scrap ALL of these ideas!"
 ne.342.b:0 "Yes, partition them between Germany, France and Italy"
 ne.342.c:0 "Partition them, but leave out the Germans"

 ne.343.t:0 "Requesting territory from Turkey?"
 ne.343.d:0 "Istanbul lies on the Bosporous Strait and whoever controls it, controls the Black Sea and access to countries like Russia, Bulgaria or Romania. In these turbolent times "evidence" could be brought up to burden the Turkish government with claims of e.g. Axis collaboration and eventually force them to cede territory.\nShould this kind of "evidence" be created or is the status quo more important?"
 ne.343.a:0 "(Historical) No, such ideas do not fit our principles!"
 ne.343.b:0 "Let the Soviets have their claims on their four states around the straits!"
 ne.343.c:0 "We don't need "evidence"! Force them to submit to our power! Partition them completely!"
 ne.343.e:0 "Forget it!"
 

 
 ne.4.t:0 "Historical Partition of Europe"
 ne.4.d:0 "Though the Western Allies and the Soviets worked together to defeat the Nazis, there have always been uneasy relations since the Russian Civil War. Since the common enemy is now defeated, first signs of 'coolness' have again appeared between the wartime allies.  Over the last few years, democracy and communism liberated Europe from fascism and recently met on the Elbe river. The USA and the USSR have now emerged as the most powerful nations on this planet while the United Kingdom has to face huge economic problems and France has to rebuild her wartorn nation. While France, Great Britain and the USA still control huge swathes of Europe, the presence of the Soviets in Central and Eastern Europe is like a thorn in the eye for them. It is unclear how the situation will develop in the following years, but it's very likely that Europe will be divided between two ideologies...\n ("Descend the Iron Curtain" adds all changes from neweurope.1 - neweurope.3 - In case you don't want to look at every country. It's also even more historical when you select the "puppet version"!"

Since we share a similar ideology, they might see in us a potential ally and would not hesitate to arm us and send military missions. Additionally, there seem to be no downsides and we might have the upper hand after [From.getAdjective] ships arrive..."
 ne_misc.6.a:0 "Help is always appreciated!"

 ne_misc.9.d:0 "Even though [From.GetName] is one of the richest and strongest nations in the world, apparently they can't spare some guns for us to defeat our mortal enemy. Now it's time to execute "Plan B", in other words we need to do it all alone: Convert every bit of industry to military production, only allow defensive operations, lower the recruitment age and let our propaganda machines work all around the clock.\nWe're on our own and this is a crucial moment in our country's history..."

 ##Titograd to Podgorica
 ne_city.12.t:0 "Reverting the name of one of our cities"

 ne_notes.1.d:0 "Germany is divided between East and West. An Iron Curtain has descended across the continent and now seperates families, friends and neighbors. The capital has met the same fate though a real wall instead of the typical fence now stands there. Some of our leaders came up with a brilliant idea: What if we can convince the West to unite Germany the same way as we did to Austria? As a neutral buffer zone, Germany will also no longer be able to attack its neighbors and our tanks won't face the American ones along the border anymore! Of course, additionally to all of this the German people would be reunited in the process as well .\nThere's just one problem: What if the Americans try to influence this neutral Germany into their zone? The hatred for us is still huge in Germany after the last war. Regardless should we send the Western Powers our proposal and hope they accept? "

 ##USA gets event

This would on one hand mitigate the Cold War and also finally reunite families and friends seperated by the Iron Curtain but we would also take the risk of losing a complete Germany to Soviet influence and in the worst case, to the Warsaw Pact. It's a difficult decision but the Soviets want an answer soon. Do you accept or decline this proposal, Mr. President?"

Korea will be divided along the 38th parallel and thus effectively create two distinct countries as both superpowers can't occupy the peninsula forever. Do we agree on [USA.GetLeader]'s plan?"
 ne_division_kor.3.a:0 "This is a good solution!"
 ne_division_kor.3.b:0 "This is unacceptable"
 
 ##USSR gets event; USA wants 1953 border
 ne_division_kor.4.t:0 "Fate of Korea - two Koreas"
 ne_division_kor.4.d:0 "Korea is still occupied and multiple plans were designed to deal with the country and her people. Now [USA.GetLeader]'s diplomats and our officials met in Vladivostok to discuss a new plan the Western Allies have proposed. The suggested idea basically will transform the peninsula into two new countries, a socialist nation in the north and a southern Korea of capitalist and "democratic" principles under American guidance. The border will be roughly around the 38th parallel but not a straight line, like it happened in Syria and Iraq.\nWhat will be our response to this partition plan?"
 ne_division_kor.4.a:0 "This actually sounds good"
 ne_division_kor.4.b:0 "No way!"
 
 ##USSR gets event; USA wants occupation
 ne_division_kor.5.t:0 "Fate of Korea - USA will continue occupation"
 ne_division_kor.5.d:0 "The American warmongers have just announced to continue their occupation of Korea for the forseeable future. This will trap the Korean people in this part of the peninsula under a repressive regime and sadly we can't help. Should we at least found a new nation for the North?"
 ne_division_kor.5.a:0 "Set an example and free our Korea!"
 ne_division_kor.5.b:0 "Damn capitalists!"
 
 ##USA gets response; SOV agrees
 ne_division_kor.6.t:0 "Fate of Korea - The Communists accept!"
 ne_division_kor.6.d:0 "Wonderful news! [SOV.GetLeader] has just announced to agree on our idea on what to do with the Korean peninsula. Our latest plan will now be turned into reality..."
 ne_division_kor.6.a:0 "One problem less..."
 
 ##USA gets response; SOV denies
 ne_division_kor.7.t:0 "Fate of Korea - the Soviets decline our proposal!"
 ne_division_kor.7.d:0 "Moscow has just told our ambassadors that our current plan for the Korean peninsula is unacceptable for them."
 ne_division_kor.7.a:0 "Maybe another idea will fit the Kremlin's interests..."

 ##MANAGER FOR ASIA##
 ne_asia.1.t:0 "Manager for Japan and Asia"
 ne_asia.1.d:0 "It's now possible for you to determine how Asia should look like. Remember that most Chinese events will trigger for the country itself\nIMPORTANT: If you click 'close' you can only return to this menu with 'event ne_asia.1'!"
 ne_asia.1.a:0 "The Japanese must pay for their crimes!"
 ##"The people in the colonies saw that we couldn't protect them; they're revolting!"
 ne_asia.1.b:0 "PLACEHOLDER, DO NOT CLICK [CLOSES MENU]"
 ne_asia.1.c:0 "The Korean people were supressed for far too long..."
 ne_asia.1.e:0 "Close and go back to the game"
 
 ##Fate of Japan
 ne_asia.2.t:0 "Fate of Japan"
 ne_asia.2.d:0 "Japan has capitulated under the might of the USA, USSR, Great Britain and China. With their defeat the Japanese will lose any territorial gains they made since they annexed Korea in 1910. What should be done to make sure that the Japanese will never threaten Asia again?"
 ne_asia.2.a:0 "The Republic of China, Soviet Union, UK and USA all get a chunk to control!"
 ne_asia.2.b:0 "It's better to split Japan into a communist and a democratic state..."
 ne_asia.2.c:0 "The PRC, USSR, UK and USA occupy them for now!"
 ne_asia.2.e:0 "It's better to split Japan into a communist and a democratic state..."
 ne_asia.2.f:0 "Return to main menu"
 
 ##Fate of Colonies
 ##not implemented yet! -> ne_asia.3 is colonies and will be done in the future
 
 ##Fate of Korea
 ne_asia.4.t:0 "Plans for Korea"
 ne_asia.4.d:0 "Korea is finally free from Japanese dependence and occupation but their independence could fuel for new conflict. In the last months of the war, the Soviets occupied the northern part of the peninsula and with the Japanese capitulation, America requested the same for the south. This ideological split across the peninsula has to be resolved somehow."
 ne_asia.4.a:0 "Divide the peninsula along the 38th parallel!"
 ne_asia.4.b:0 "(Historical) The USSR and USA should continue control"
 ne_asia.4.c:0 "Decrease tensions by creating a random border and enforce demilitarization!"
 ne_asia.4.e:0 "Return to main menu"

 
 ##1. DPR gets event to declare war on south 2. South is then in panic; make sure to include whitepeace and division check for north
 
 ##KOREAN WAR##
 ne_korean_war.1.t:0 "Reuniting the Peninsula"
 ne_korean_war.1.d:0 "Our beautiful nation is split into two and the traitorous Americans have set up a puppet state to gain control over the region. Our nation is young and now the time has come to reunite the Korean people before it's too late and our southern brothers will be brainwashed by American propaganda. We need to strike now...or never! "
 ne_korean_war.1.a:0 "Let's free our comrades in the south!"
 ne_korean_war.1.b:0 "This war would have no winner!"
 
 ##Event for SK to get prepared
 ne_korean_war.2.t:0 "The North is invading us!"
 ne_korean_war.2.d:0 "Our forward observers near the DMZ report enemy divisions corssing into our territory! We've already lost some small villages and it won't be long until heavy fighting will take place! Our generals have hastily mobilized several battalions to delay the enemy as long as possible while our meager frontline troops try to setup defenses in cities and roadblocks.\n This is our darkest hour and the Korean people now must stand in unity to deter the communist invaders. Let's show these bastards how willing we are to defend our freedom and families!"
 ne_korean_war.2.a:0 "Evacuate Seoul immediately!"
 
 ##Cease fire event: NEEDS GERMAN LOCALISATION
 ne_korean_war.3.t:0 "The war is a stalemate!"
 ne_korean_war.3.d:0 "Several months ago we started our offensive into the southern half of the peninsula but we were ultimately driven back. Thanks to Chinese help the front stabilized around the old border and it seems like both sides are exhausted and weary of war. Should we ask for a cease-fire to replenish our forces and plan new offensives? Those things usually don't last very long anyway... "
 ne_korean_war.3.a:0 "Propose a cease-fire"
 ne_korean_war.3.b:0 "The war can still be won!"
 
 ##South can either accept or deny this proposal
 ne_korean_war.4.t:0 "Cease-fire proposal from the North!"
 ne_korean_war.4.d:0 "Both Koreas are now fighting for months and neither we nor they have gained any significant advantages. The front resembles the First World War and our country lies in poverty; destroyed by war. [DPR.GetLeader] has sent us an offer for a simple cease-fire so the Korean people can escape the suffering for a few weeks probably. Do we accept?"
 ne_korean_war.4.a:0 "Our people will thank us..."
 ne_korean_war.4.b:0 "They are almost destroyed, no way!"
