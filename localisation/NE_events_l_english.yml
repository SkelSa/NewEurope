This leads to unhistorical and unrealistic scenarios and usually screws up the flow of World War II.\nThe following option will give some nations like for instance Switzerland, Sweden or Turkey a neutrality spirit to avoid any faction joining during the war. The spirits will be removed should any country be dragged into a defensive conflict however.\nSpain is also handled via this though their neutrality is handled via events and world situation."

Instead, they would have to achieve a lot of party popularity. Several national spirits help you to see when a country would be ready to join. If they are a great power, Players can invite some countries earlier into their faction via the diplomacy slots while any AI-only faction requires any potential new members to have a really high party popularity among some other minor conditions. Historical invitations are done via event however.\nChoose now what you want."

Since we share a similar ideology, they might see in us a potential ally and would not hesitate to arm us and send military missions. Additionally, there seem to be no downsides and we might have the upper hand after [From.getAdjective] ships arrive..."

Now it's time to execute "Plan B", in other words we need to do it all alone: Convert every bit of industry to military production, only allow defensive operations, lower the recruitment age and let our propaganda machines work all around the clock.\nWe're on our own and this is a crucial moment in our country's history..."

 ##Titograd to Podgorica
 ne_city.12.t:0 "Reverting the name of one of our cities"
 ne_city.12.d:0 "We still have a city named after the leader of the KPJ, Josip Broz Tito.

 ne_notes.1.d:0 "Germany is divided between East and West. An Iron Curtain has descended across the continent and now seperates families, friends and neighbors. The capital has met the same fate though a real wall instead of the typical fence now stands there. Some of our leaders came up with a brilliant idea: What if we can convince the West to unite Germany the same way as we did to Austria? As a neutral buffer zone, Germany will also no longer be able to attack its neighbors and our tanks won't face the American ones along the border anymore! Of course, additionally to all of this the German people would be reunited in the process as well .\nThere's just one problem: What if the Americans try to influence this neutral Germany into their zone? The hatred for us is still huge in Germany after the last war. Regardless should we send the Western Powers our proposal and hope they accept? "

 ##USA gets event

 ne_notes.2.d:0 "The ambassadors from Moscow have offered us an opportunity to reunite the German nation and keep them neutral as a buffer zone between our blocs. This would on one hand mitigate the Cold War and also finally reunite families and friends seperated by the Iron Curtain but we would also take the risk of losing a complete Germany to Soviet influence and in the worst case, to the Warsaw Pact. It's a difficult decision but the Soviets want an answer soon. Do you accept or decline this proposal, Mr. President?"

There's just a small problem: Both the USSR and USA control the North and South respectively and while the Reds want to see a  striving socialist nation, the Americans would rather have an ally in Asia to stop the spread of communism. To find a suitable solution we may have to divide the peninsula since both parties fought hard to regain their chunk of land..."

The suggested idea basically will transform the peninsula into two new countries, a socialist nation in the north and a southern Korea of capitalist and "democratic" principles under American guidance. The border will be roughly around the 38th parallel but not a straight line, like it happened in Syria and Iraq.\nWhat will be our response to this partition plan?"

 ne_prc.21.d:0 "Since the defeat of Japan and the countless peace conferences following we've managed to take control over some territory in the former area of Manchuria and Menjiang and thus secured a foothold in East Asia. Unfortunately the people are not exactly happy over our rule there and just shortly the People's Republic of China has issued claims over territories they lost against the Japanese. Most of our ministers support to return Manchuria but actually doing this would end our presence on the Yellow Sea. Diplomatically seen, this could actually prove to be a chance of a new ally, be it in trading or alliances..."

When considering many acute questions, Comrade Malenkov shows indecision, without taking a definite position. These shortcomings in the business qualities of Comrade Malenkov are extremely detrimental to the work of the Council of Ministers."

According to the Soviet press, which is classified as state propaganda by us, "the politically unstable Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were unable to protect themselves from fascist propaganda and posed a great danger to the Soviet Union".\nIt's very unlikely that this statement holds even a bit of truth and we assume that the three countries on the Baltic coast were targeted to deny the German influence there. nevertheless, this action clearly violates the sovereignty and neutral intentions of these countries. While we can't do much about it and this event is minor compred to the war between England, France and Germany, let us still write a strongly-worded letter to the Soviets.

Without suprise, the League breached its own regulations to ensure our exit by choosing South Africa, Bolivia and Egypt as Council members just yesterday.\nHowever, the loss of our five-year old membership will not have any real consequences for us. The organization has failed multiple times to solve any conflicts in the past and with the ongoing world war, it will probably dissolve soon."
 ne_skelsa.85.a:0 "It was a useless organisation anyway."
 
 ##SOV develops KV-1 and T-34
 ne_skelsa.86.t:0 "New Tanks have been tested!"
 ne_skelsa.86.d:0 "While the Red Army is equipped with tens of thousands of tanks, most are just older T-26 or BT-5. In the Spanish Civil War they were tested in real combat and this was when our general staff realized that we have to invest heavily in new designs and models. Back in 1937 we tasked various scientists and tank designers, including Mikhail Koshkin, with developing new state-of-the-art tanks which should defeat any enemy they face.\nYesterday, after several prototypes and countless tests our designers have finally presented their latest blueprints. Both tank models, one being a medium tank and the other one a heavy, can be mass-produced, are easy to maintain and feature good armor, mobility and firepower. Model "T-34", which came out of the "A-32" prototype, has a sloped armor up to 45 mm thick, uses a 76 mm gun and two MGs and can reach a top speed of 53 km/h. Our new heavy tank, the "Kliment Voroshilov 1", ot "KV-1" is with 35 km/h slower, but has a front armor of 75 mm while using the same gun as the "T-34". It already came out last year but our tank designers made some significant improvements.\nMost tests have shown good results in the combat effectiveness but it's still unknown how well the new tanks will perform against a real enemy. While being superior in most aspects compared to German, French or British tanks, they still lack radios and the optics could be better. Additionally, several conservative elements in our government have voiced their concerns about the "T-34", criticizing the high production cost. Nevertheless, the tank plants "Kirov" and "Komintern Locomotive Factory" have already begun the production and delivered some tanks to the Red Army. Several other tank factories, like "Red October", have also announced to begin mass-production. Due to the vast amount of Soviet tank corps it will probably take some years to fully modernize them."

Most of our experts predict that Hanko might be the best choice but of course they will accept your final decision."

 ##Oppress the Baltic States
 ne_skelsa.60.t:0 "Soviet Bases in the Baltic States"
 ne_skelsa.60.d:0 "Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, also known as the Baltic States, are broken shards from the Russian Empire still not reunited with us. Their independence will never be justified and we need to bring them into our fold before it's too late! While a direct annexation or invasion might be considered aggressive by other foreign powers, the Politburo came up with an idea to slowly subjugate the three nations. In the end we will replace their governments and this will lead to their integration into our motherland. Let's start by demanding military bases and access. Either they accept or our tanks will cross the border! Considering our military power we can expect our goal soon - no matter which option is chosen."

Agreeing to these demands could probably satisfy [SOV.GetLeader] for now but it's very likely the Reds will return with even more demands, some of which may threaten our sovereignty!

Even if we don’t capture much territory, the new border between our nation and the Reich is already determined and it’s highly unlikely that the Nazis would not comply.\nOur media will simply portray the invasion as an act to protect our minorities in the region.

While millions of families bury their dead loved ones, Chairman Mao has promised his people a prosperous future and a new era for China, with the principles of equality, justice and socialism.\n While this development will surely influence the politics of China's neighbours, it's still a question how and where Mao Zedong will lead his nation.

There wasn't much information else, however it's assumed that Hitler comitted suicide in his bunker in Berlin to avoid captivity by the enemy surrounding the Reichshauptstadt. The whereabouts of the other NSDAP politicians or Eva Braun is unknown, though it is assumed they're either dead or fleeing. \n Since most of the Reich is occupied and the Wehrmacht is near collapse, the death of Hitler is probably the last nail to the coffin of German morale.

Several German generals are convinced that Adolf Hitler has really lost any contact with the reality and still commands around divisions which no longer exist.

During the occupation, a process called "denazification" will follow to eradicate thoughts about a revival of fascism and militarism.

Like his right-wing counterpart, Hitler, who was born in Austria, Joseph Stalin was not a native of the country he ruled with an iron fist. Isoeb Dzhugashvili was born in 1889 in Georgia, then part of the old Russian empire. The son of a drunk who beat him mercilessly and a pious washerwoman mother, Stalin learned Russian, which he spoke with a heavy accent all his life, in an Orthodox Church-run school. While studying to be a priest at Tiflis Theological Seminary, he began secretly reading Karl Marx and other left-wing revolutionary thinkers. The “official” communist story is that he was expelled from the seminary for this intellectual rebellion; in reality, it may have been because of poor health."

Thanks to several recon units who reported a build up of troops outside of the enclave, the units of W. Berlin were already on high alert.

The West, taken by surprise, threatened a trade embargo against East Germany as a retaliatory measure. The Soviets responded that such an embargo be answered with a new land blockade of West Berlin. When it became evident that the West was not going to take any major action to protest the closing, East German authorities became emboldened, closing off more and more checkpoints between East and West Berlin. On August 15, they began replacing barbed wire with concrete. The wall, East German authorities declared, would protect their citizens from the pernicious influence of decadent capitalist culture."
