 ne_news.1.d:0 "This mod aims to expand and enhance a historical playthrough as one of the Allied nations. Besides several new states to allow the recreation of a new world, BPWE features dozens of historical events and other content to allow the begin of the Cold War after the defeat of Nazi Germany and her allies.\nDue to the increasing lag in the lategame a focus was laid on events which happened before 1955 in our timeline. WW3 stuff is also included.\nThis mod was intended for historical playthroughs and thus ahistorical games will prevent a lot of content. Please try to keep this in mind.\nAnd now have fun!"

Instead, they would have to achieve a lot of party popularity. Several national spirits help you to see when a country would be ready to join. If they are a great power, Players can invite some countries earlier into their faction via the diplomacy slots while any AI-only faction requires any potential new members to have a really high party popularity among some other minor conditions.

 #Germany: Pressure on Bulgaria to join the Axis
 ne_historical.1.t:0 "Pressure on Bulgaria"
 ne_historical.1.d:0 "Our ally [ITA.GetLeader] is doing poorly in Greece and future invasion plans can't be postponed. Even though Greece is a small and weak country, we need to occupy it before the British can send reinforcements! It is time to bring Bulgaria into our alliance and fight the Greeks from their territory too. They will for sure join our alliance after we offer our rewards..."
 ne_historical.1.a:0 "Put the pressure on them!"
 ne_historical.1.b:0 "This is no real solution!"
 #Bulgaria: Join Axis or not
 ne_historical.2.t:0 "Germany demands that we sign the Tripartite Pact?"
 ne_historical.2.d:0 "The German ambassadors have just arrived in our capital and told [BUL.GetLeader] that the Axis demands Bulgaria's entry into the alliance and a joint invasion of our southern neighbour. As a reward, they promised us several territories we lost after the Great War plus German economic and military aid. Do we accept?"
 ne_historical.2.a:0 "We sign it."
 ne_historical.2.b:0 "We will never be an Axis puppet!"
 #Germany: Bulgaria agrees to join
 ne_historical.3.t:0 "Bulgaria accepts!"
 ne_historical.3.d:0 "[BUL.GetLeader] has accepted our proposal and Bulgaria is now part of the Axis!"
 ne_historical.3.a:0 "Very good."
 #Germany: Bulgaria refuses
 ne_historical.4.t:0 "Bulgaria refuses?!"
 ne_historical.4.d:0 "The ambassadors from Sofia have politely refused our proposal and stressed Bulgaria's desire to keep out of international affairs..."
 ne_historical.4.a:0 "We made our warnings clear..."
 ne_historical.4.b:0 "They would have been a useless ally anyways."
 
 
 
 ##WARNING: Historical Focus not on!
 ne_skelsa.75.t:0 "Warning: Historical Focus Setting Not On!"
 ne_skelsa.75.d:0 "This savegame was started without historical focuses. As most events and decisions rely on them, it's strongly advised to turn them on for the best experience."
 ne_skelsa.75.a:0 "Thanks for the warning!"
 
 ##Germany: Divide up Yugoslavia
 ne_skelsa.76.t:0 "The Fate of Yugoslavia"
 ne_skelsa.76.d:0 "The artificial state of Yugoslavia could not withstand the might of our - and our allies - military and surrendered! The Hungarian, German, Bulgarian and Italian minorities there are now finally free and again another mistake of Versailles is undone!\nWe have already discussed how to deal with the Yugoslavian carcass and it would be beneficial for all to divide the land among our allies. They fought hard and should be rewarded with their rightful clay."
 ne_skelsa.76.a:0 "Finally!"
 ne_skelsa.76.b:0 "The current occupation is fine."
 
 ##Germany: Divide up Greece
 ne_skelsa.77.t:0 "The Fate of Greece"
 ne_skelsa.77.d:0 "Even though the Greek people fought valiantly and brave they were no match for the combined forces of the Axis Powers. Mussolini's failed invasion will hopefully be forgotten once this war is won.\nLike with Yugoslavia, do we partition them among our allies? We can decide about the Greek nation once the Allies sign a peace treaty..."
 ne_skelsa.77.a:0 "It was about time..."
 ne_skelsa.77.b:0 "The current occupation is fine."

 ne_skelsa.1.d:0 "One of our most famous singers, Brother Hao, has just asked us to join our glorious army as a corps commander.

 ne_skelsa.1.a:0 "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China!"

 ##Lease of Finnish Port
 ne_fin_harbor.1.t:0 "Lease of Finnish Ports"
 ne_fin_harbor.1.d:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are allowed to use Finnish ports as a military leasehold. The naval ports of Hanko and Porkalla located on the Gulf of Finland seem suited enough to support our Baltic Fleet and thus extend our range in the Baltic Sea.\nNo matter which port we choose, the lease contract, which all parties agreed on, will expire in 30 years and then the port will be Finnish again. Most of our experts predict that Hanko might be the best choice but of course they will accept your final decision."
 ne_fin_harbor.1.a:0 "Hanko is our choice."
 ne_fin_harbor.1.b:0 "Let's decide for Porkalla!"
 ne_fin_harbor.1.c:0 "Why not both?"
 ne_fin_harbor.1.e:0 "We have acquired enough territory already."
 ##Finland: Info-Event about lost ports

 ne_fin_harbor.2.t4:0 "The Soviets are not interested in our ports!"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d1:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using the peninsula near Hanko as a new base for the Red Fleet. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our port back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d2:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using the peninsula near Porkalla as a new base for the Red Fleet. Even though we hoped that they would decide for the Hanko peninsula as Porkalla is just right next to Helsinki, we have no choice but to accept this decision. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our port back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d3:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using both naval bases, Hanko and Porkalla, for the Red Fleet. The message from the Kremlin has caused heated debates among our politicians and people have already protested on the streets, but unfortunately we have no choice but to accept this decision. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our ports back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d4:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. However, the Soviet government has just announced to drop this plan and now they're not interested anymore in a lease contract. Exact reasons for this decision are still unknown but it's probably a gesture of friendship towards us.\nEen though Finland lost a lot of valuable territory, we still get to keep our ports."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.a:0 "Let's hope that they keep their word..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.b:0 "Damn imperialists!"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.c:0 "This was a surprising move."

 ne_nato.5.d:0 "Turkey and Greece control the Mediterranean and more importanly the Bosporus. While they're surrounded by socialist countries, we may offer them protection while gaining access over their strategic locations. This, however, may provoke an unknown Soviet response.\nDo we send out the invites?"
 ne_nato.5.a:0 "More members are always welcome!"

 ##17th September 1939
 ne_skelsa.200.t:0 "Invading Poland?"
 ne_skelsa.200.d:0 "Like we agreed in our non-aggression pact with the Germans, we are obliged to attack Poland some time after the German invasion. Even though the Wehrmacht has effectively destroyed the Polish Army and is advancing towards Warsaw, our help could end Poland quicker.\nWe finally have the opportunity to reclaim our lost lands from 1920 and reverse our disastrous defeat against Piłsudski once and for all! Even if we don’t capture much territory, the new border between our nation and the Reich is already determined and it’s highly unlikely that the Nazis would not comply.\nOur media will simply portray the invasion as an act to protect our minorities in the region. France and the United Kingdom already have their hands full and a war is thus very unlikely..."
 ne_skelsa.200.a:0 "Finally we can revenge 1920!"
 ne_skelsa.200.b:0 "Why waste soldiers when we will get Eastern Poland anyways?"
 
 ##Polish Reaction
 ne_skelsa.201.t:0 "The Soviets are invading us!"
 ne_skelsa.201.d:0 "Our eastern border guards are under heavy attack and we already have lost contact to many units. It seems like the Russians also made a deal with the Germans to carve us up!"
 ne_skelsa.201.a:0 "We need to delay them as long as we can!"
 
 ##German reaction
 ne_skelsa.202.t:0 "The Soviets kept their Promise!"
 ne_skelsa.202.d:0 "Our military intelligence just reported that the Soviets are now also invading Poland from the East. It seems like the Bolsheviks can indeed keep promises.\nThe fall of Poland is only days away now."
 ne_skelsa.202.a:0 "Let's hope the Bolsheviks lose some good men..."
 
 ##English reaction
 ne_skelsa.204.t:0 "The Soviets are attacking Poland!"
 ne_skelsa.204.d:0 "The Polish intelligence could confirm that the Red Army is indeed invading the eastern parts of Poland and has already taken several cities. With the rapid advance of the Germans and now a new front on the eastern border, we're afraid to say that the situation for our Polish friends is indeed very grim. Our military experts predict that the nation will be fully occupied in about two to four weeks.\nSeveral of our politicians are calling for a declaration of war against the Russians as well but considering the consequences it will have, this could be suicide."
 ne_skelsa.204.a:0 "Poland is lost!"

 ##Prepared
 ne_news.22.t:0 "West-Berlin Garrison has surrendered!"
 ne_news.22.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. While several American and British commanders expected the enclave to fall within a day, the West German, British, French and American divisions, some the size of brigades, offered heavy resistance and could delay the Eastern Bloc forces longer than initially expected. Thanks to several recon units who reported a build up of troops outside of the enclave, the units of W. Berlin were already on high alert. Nevertheless, the sheer amount of enemy forces forced them to abandon several positions like the Moltke Bridge early on.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite the rest of Germany once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

 ##Unprepared
 ne_news.23.t:0 "West-Berlin Garrison has surrendered!"
 ne_news.23.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. Due to the sheer mass of Communist forces, no preparation and the element of surprise on the Soviet side, several American and British commanders were shocked as they heard that most divisions in Berlin, mostly West German, British, French and American, offered no to little resistance and surrendered in mere hours. According to some eyewitnesses, the wall seperating the two Berlins was blown up after an intense air and artillery bombardment. While the loss of West Berlin was in a way unavoidable, it is still a huge blow to the West.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

 ##Berlin Wall
 ne_news.24.t:0 "The Berlin Wall is finished!"
 ne_news.24.d:0 "East German soldiers laid down more than 30 miles of barbed wire barrier through the heart of Berlin. East Berlin citizens were forbidden to pass into West Berlin, and the number of checkpoints in which Westerners could cross the border was drastically reduced. The West, taken by surprise, threatened a trade embargo against East Germany as a retaliatory measure. The Soviets responded that such an embargo be answered with a new land blockade of West Berlin. When it became evident that the West was not going to take any major action to protest the closing, East German authorities became emboldened, closing off more and more checkpoints between East and West Berlin. On August 15, they began replacing barbed wire with concrete. The wall, East German authorities declared, would protect their citizens from the pernicious influence of decadent capitalist culture."
 ne_news.24.a:0 "We will protect the inhabitants of Berlin from the influence of Western capitalism!"
 ne_news.24.b:0 "This is a shock to all of us!"
 ne_news.24.c:0 "It does not concern us."
 ne_news.24.e:0 "This wall is a wall of shame!"
