 ##HISTORICAL FIXES EVENTS##
 
 #Germany: Pressure on Bulgaria to join the Axis
 ne_historical.1.t:0 "Pressure on Bulgaria"
 ne_historical.1.d:0 "Our ally [ITA.GetLeader] is doing poorly in Greece and future invasion plans can't be postponed. Even though Greece is a small and weak country, we need to occupy it before the British can send reinforcements there! It is time to bring Bulgaria into our alliance and fight the Greeks from their territory too. They will for sure join our alliance after we offer our rewards..."
 ne_historical.1.a:0 "Put the pressure on them!"
 ne_historical.1.b:0 "This is no real solution!"
 #Bulgaria: Join Axis or not
 ne_historical.2.t:0 "Germany demands that we sign the Tripartite Pact?"
 ne_historical.2.d:0 "The German ambassadors have just arrived in our capital and told [BUL.GetLeader] that the Axis demands Bulgaria's entry into the alliance and a joint invasion of our southern neighbour. As a reward, they promised us several territories we lost after the Great War plus German economic and military aid. Do we accept?"
 ne_historical.2.a:0 "We sign it."
 ne_historical.2.b:0 "We will never be an Axis puppet!"
 #Germany: Bulgaria agrees to join
 ne_historical.3.t:0 "Bulgaria accepts!"
 ne_historical.3.d:0 "[BUL.GetLeader] has accepted our proposal and Bulgaria is now part of the Axis!"
 ne_historical.3.a:0 "Very good."
 #Germany: Bulgaria refuses
 ne_historical.4.t:0 "Bulgaria refuses?!"
 ne_historical.4.d:0 "The ambassadors from Sofia have politely refused our proposal and stressed Bulgaria's desire to keep out of international affairs."
 ne_historical.4.a:0 "We made our warnings clear..."
 ne_historical.4.b:0 "They would have been a useless ally anyways."
 
 
 #Japan: Get Event about bad infrastructure in China
 ne_historical.5.t:0 "Problems in China!"
 ne_historical.5.d:0 "We have advanced far into the Chinese mainland but our troops there are facing huge supply issues! Partisans and bad road and railway connections are a significant strain on our supply logistics. Not advancing at all might be the best solution for now."
 ne_historical.5.a:0 "Oh well..."
 #Supply situation better now
 ne_historical.6.t:0 "Our Supply situation has improved!"
 ne_historical.6.d:0 "Though we were pushed back by Chinese forces a bit our supply routes have been shortened and are less frequently attacked. Most of the IJA faces a good supply of munitions, guns, food and men."
 ne_historical.6.a:0 "Good."

 ##US condemns Soviet expansionism
 ne_skelsa.83.t:0 "The USSR violates Baltic neutrality!"
 ne_skelsa.83.d:0 "The Kremlin has just ordered its troops to cross the border into the neighbouring Baltic states! According to the Soviet press, which is classified as state propaganda by us, "the politically unstable Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were unable to protect themselves from fascist propaganda and posed a great danger to the Soviet Union".\nIt's very unlikely that this statement holds even a bit of truth and we assume that the three countries on the Baltic coast were targeted to deny the German influence there. nevertheless, this action clearly violates the sovereignty and neutral intentions of these countries. While we can't do much about it and this event is minor compred to the war between England, France and Germany, let us still write a strongly-worded letter to the Soviets. They should know that we refuse to recognize their occupation."

[USA.GetLeader] also announced support for the old Baltic government and stated, that as long as Soviet troops are occupying Baltic territory, relations between the US and USSR will suffer.\nDue to the isolationist stance of the United States of America we can safely ignore this letter. It's just a matter of time until they have to accept our new borders."

Without suprise, the League breached its own regulations to ensure our exit by choosing South Africa, Bolivia and Egypt as Council members just yesterday.\nHowever, the loss of our five-year old membership will not have any real consequences for us. The organization has failed multiple times to solve any conflicts in the past and with the ongoing world war, it will probably dissolve soon."
 ne_skelsa.85.a:0 "It was a useless organization anyway."
 
 ##SOV develops KV-1 and T-34
 ne_skelsa.86.t:0 "New Tanks have been tested!"
 ne_skelsa.86.d:0 "While the Red Army is equipped with tens of thousands of tanks, most are just older T-26 or BT-5. In the Spanish Civil War they were tested in real combat and this was when our general staff realized that we have to invest heavily in new designs and models. Back in 1937 we tasked various scientists and tank designers, including Mikhail Koshkin, with developing new state-of-the-art tanks which should defeat any enemy they face.\nYesterday, after several prototypes and countless tests our designers have finally presented their latest blueprints. Both tank models, one being a medium tank and the other one a heavy, can be mass-produced, are easy to maintain and feature good armor, mobility and firepower. Model "T-34", which came out of the "A-32" prototype, has a sloped armor up to 45 mm thick, uses a 76 mm gun and two MGs and can reach a top speed of 53 km/h. Our new heavy tank, the "Kliment Voroshilov 1", ot "KV-1" is with 35 km/h slower, but has a front armor of 75 mm while using the same gun as the "T-34". It already came out last year but our tank designers made some significant improvements.\nMost tests have shown good results in the combat effectiveness but it's still unknown how well the new tanks will perform against a real enemy. While being superior in most aspects compared to German, French or British tanks, they still lack radios and the optics could be better. Additionally, several conservative elements in our government have voiced their concerns about the "T-34", criticizing the high production cost. Nevertheless, the tank plants "Kirov" and "Komintern Locomotive Factory" have already begun the production and delivered some tanks to the Red Army. Several other tank factories, like "Red October", have also announced to begin mass-production. Due to the vast amount of Soviet tank corps it will probably take some years to fully modernize them."

Their independence will never be justified and we need to bring them into our fold before it's too late! While a direct annexation or invasion might be considered aggressive by other foreign powers, the Politburo came up with an idea to slowly subjugate the three nations. In the end we will replace their governments and this will lead to their integration into our motherland. Let's start by demanding military bases and access. Either they accept or our tanks will cross the border! Considering our military power we can expect our goal soon - no matter which option is chosen."

Allegedly to combat the fascist threat, they want the right to station their troops in our country and get ownership of some of our military bases.\nAccording to foreign press, the two other Baltic nations are facing the same question right now too. Agreeing to these demands could probably satisfy [SOV.GetLeader] for now but it's very likely the Reds will return with even more demands, some of which may threaten our sovereignty! However, declining their ultimatum might be our certain end.\nWhat should we do?"

 ##Battle of Berlin## --> Two versions: Garrison unprepared and prepared
 ##Prepared
 ne_news.22.t:0 "West-Berlin Garrison has surrendered!"
 ne_news.22.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. While several American and British commanders expected the enclave to fall within a day, the West German, British, French and American divisions, some the size of brigades, offered heavy resistance and could delay the Eastern Bloc forces longer than initially expected. Thanks to several recon units who reported a build up of troops outside of the enclave, the units of W. Berlin were already on high alert. Nevertheless, the sheer amount of enemy forces forced them to abandon several positions like the Moltke Bridge early on.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite the rest of Germany once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

 ##Unprepared
 ne_news.23.t:0 "West-Berlin Garrison has surrendered!"
 ne_news.23.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. Due to the sheer mass of Communist forces, no preparation and the element of surprise on the Soviet side, several American and British commanders were shocked as they heard that most divisions in Berlin, mostly West German, British, French and American, offered no to little resistance and surrendered in mere hours. According to some eyewitnesses, the wall seperating the two Berlins was blown up after an intense air and artillery bombardment. While the loss of West Berlin was in a way unavoidable, it is still a huge blow to the West.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

 ##Berlin Wall
 ne_news.24.t:0 "The Berlin Wall is finished!"
 ne_news.24.d:0 "East German soldiers laid down more than 30 miles of barbed wire barrier through the heart of Berlin. East Berlin citizens were forbidden to pass into West Berlin, and the number of checkpoints in which Westerners could cross the border was drastically reduced. The West, taken by surprise, threatened a trade embargo against East Germany as a retaliatory measure. The Soviets responded that such an embargo be answered with a new land blockade of West Berlin. When it became evident that the West was not going to take any major action to protest the closing, East German authorities became emboldened, closing off more and more checkpoints between East and West Berlin. On August 15, they began replacing barbed wire with concrete. The wall, East German authorities declared, would protect their citizens from the pernicious influence of decadent capitalist culture."

 ##Soviets enter German soil
 ne_news.27.t:0 "Red Army enters German soil"
 ne_news.27.d:0 "After several years of brutal fighting in the East, numerous bloody battles and staggering losses, Soviet forces have finally entered German territory for the first time since the start of the war. While several territories annexed by Germany during the war were already captured, this time the Soviets entered the borders of Germany from 1937.\nWhile this marks an important step towards Germany’s defeat, many atrocities committed by soldiers of the Red Army have already taken place against German civilians. Cases such as rape, looting and the destruction of houses as revenge for German atrocities are becoming more common. Stavka has not yet made a statement concerning this but it’s very likely that these crimes will not go unpunished in the future."
 ne_news.27.a:0 "Next stop: Berlin!"

 ##Poland collapses (LOC needs a redo) (removed the part about the national treasury and the feeling of betrayal towards the West)
 ne_news.46.t:0 "Poland collapses!"
 ne_news.46.d:0 "[POL.GetLeader] has announced in a radio broadcast that, despite the massive sacrifice of the Polish people, the country could no longer withstand the combined might of the German and Soviet armies. While some smaller pockets of resistance are still fighting against the occupiers it's expected that they won't last until the end of the week.\nAccording to Romanian sources, about 120000 troops could escape via the "Romanian Bridgehead" to join the British and French armies in the West to continue the fight against Nazi Germany.\nMost experts are convinced that Germany, now turning to Paris, will have enormous difficulties penetrating heavy French fortifications along the border. However, this remains to be seen."
