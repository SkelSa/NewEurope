Besides several new states to allow the recreation of a new world, BPWE features dozens of historical events and other content to allow the begin of the Cold War after the defeat of Nazi Germany and her allies.\nDue to the increasing lag in the lategame a focus was laid on events which happened before 1955 in our timeline. WW3 stuff is also included.\nThis mod was intended for historical playthroughs and thus ahistorical games will prevent a lot of content. Please try to keep this in mind.\nAnd now have fun!"

Additionally, Japan will not join the war against the USSR when Germany does.\nThe stricter rules for NATO/WP mean that not every democratic country can join NATO, for instance, instantly. Instead, they would have to achieve a lot of party popularity. Several national spirits help you to see when a country would be ready to join. If they are a great power, Players can invite some countries earlier into their faction via the diplomacy slots while any AI-only faction requires any potential new members to have a really high party popularity among some other minor conditions. Historical invitations are done via event however.\nChoose now what you want."

 ##HISTORICAL FIXES EVENTS##
 
 #Germany: Pressure on Bulgaria to join the Axis
 ne_historical.1.t:0 "Pressure on Bulgaria"
 ne_historical.1.d:0 "Our ally [ITA.GetLeader] is doing poorly in Greece and future invasion plans can't be postponed. Even though Greece is a small and weak country, we need to occupy it before the British can send reinforcements! It is time to bring Bulgaria into our alliance and fight the Greeks from their territory too. They will for sure join our alliance after we offer our rewards..."
 ne_historical.1.a:0 "Put the pressure on them!"
 ne_historical.1.b:0 "This is no real solution!"
 #Bulgaria: Join Axis or not
 ne_historical.2.t:0 "Germany demands that we sign the Tripartite Pact?"
 ne_historical.2.d:0 "The German ambassadors have just arrived in our capital and told [BUL.GetLeader] that the Axis demands Bulgaria's entry into the alliance and a joint invasion of our southern neighbour. As a reward, they promised us several territories we lost after the Great War plus German economic and military aid. Do we accept?"
 ne_historical.2.a:0 "We sign it."
 ne_historical.2.b:0 "We will never be an Axis puppet!"
 #Germany: Bulgaria agrees to join
 ne_historical.3.t:0 "Bulgaria accepts!"
 ne_historical.3.d:0 "[BUL.GetLeader] has accepted our proposal and Bulgaria is now part of the Axis!"
 ne_historical.3.a:0 "Very good."
 #Germany: Bulgaria refuses
 ne_historical.4.t:0 "Bulgaria refuses?!"
 ne_historical.4.d:0 "The ambassadors from Sofia have politely refused our proposal and stressed Bulgaria's desire to keep out of international affairs..."
 ne_historical.4.a:0 "We made our warnings clear..."
 ne_historical.4.b:0 "They would have been a useless ally anyways."
 
 ##India is free
 ne_skelsa.75.t:0 "We're free from British Rule!"
 ne_skelsa.75.d:0 "We're finally free from British Yoke!"
 ne_skelsa.75.a:0 "This is a new era for our country!"
 
 ##WARNING: Historical Focus not on!
 ne_skelsa.75.t:0 "Warning: Historical Focus Setting Not On!"
 ne_skelsa.75.d:0 "This savegame was started without enabled historical focuses! As most events and decisions rely on them, it's strongly advised to turn them on for the best gameplay experience."
 ne_skelsa.75.a:0 "Thanks for the warning!"
 
 ##Germany: Divide up Yugoslavia
 ne_skelsa.76.t:0 "The Fate of Yugoslavia"
 ne_skelsa.76.d:0 "The artificial state of Yugoslavia could not withstand the might of our - and our allies - military and surrendered! The Hungarian, German, Bulgarian and Italian minorities there are now finally free and again another mistake of Versailles is undone!\nWe have already discussed how to deal with the Yugoslavian carcass and it would be beneficial for all to divide the land among our allies. They fought hard and should be rewarded with their rightful clay."
 ne_skelsa.76.a:0 "Finally!"
 ne_skelsa.76.b:0 "The current occupation is fine."
 
 ##Germany: Divide up Greece
 ne_skelsa.77.t:0 "The Fate of Greece"
 ne_skelsa.77.d:0 "Even though the Greek people fought valiantly and brave they were no match for the combined forces of the Axis Powers. Mussolini's failed invasion will hopefully be forgotten once this war is won.\nLike with Yugoslavia, do we partition them among our allies? We can decide about the Greek nation once and for all after the Allies have signed a peace treaty with us..."
 ne_skelsa.77.a:0 "It was about time..."
 ne_skelsa.77.b:0 "The current occupation is fine."
 
 ##US condemns Soviet expansionism
 ne_skelsa.83.t:0 "The USSR violates Baltic neutrality!"
 ne_skelsa.83.d:0 "The Kremlin has just ordered its troops to cross the border into the neighbouring Baltic states! According to the Soviet press, which is classified as state propaganda by us, "the politically unstable Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were unable to protect themselves from fascist propaganda and posed a great danger to the Soviet Union".\nIt's very unlikely that this statement holds even a bit of truth and we assume that the three countries on the Baltic coast were targeted to deny the German influence there. nevertheless, this action clearly violates the sovereignty and neutral intentions of these countries. While we can't do much about it and this event is minor compred to the war between England, France and Germany, let us still write a strongly-worded letter to the Soviets. They should know that we refuse to recognize their occupation."
 ne_skelsa.83.a:0 "We condemn this."
 
 ##SOV gets response to US condemnation
 ne_skelsa.84.t:0 "The United States criticizes our Actions in the Baltics!"
 ne_skelsa.84.d:0 "The United States, one of the most imperialist nations on Earth, has just let us know that their government won't recognize our "occupation" of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. [USA.GetLeader] also announced support for the old Baltic government and stated, that as long as Soviet troops are occupying Baltic territory, relations between the US and USSR will suffer.\nDue to the isolationist stance of the United States of America we can safely ignore this letter. It's just a matter of time until they have to accept our new borders."
 ne_skelsa.84.a:0 "We don't care about their opinion."
 
 ##SOV gets kicked out of the LoN
 ne_skelsa.85.t:0 "We were kicked out of the League of Nations!"
 ne_skelsa.85.d:0 "As a result of our war against Finland we were kicked out of the League of Nations today. 7 out of 15 Council members, including Great Britain, France and Belgium, voted for our expulsion. Without suprise, the League breached its own regulations to ensure our exit by choosing South Africa, Bolivia and Egypt as Council members just yesterday.\nHowever, the loss of our five-year old membership will not have any real consequences for us. The organization has failed multiple times to solve any conflicts in the past and with the ongoing world war, it will probably dissolve soon."
 ne_skelsa.85.a:0 "It was a useless organization anyway."
 
 ##SOV develops KV-1 and T-34
 ne_skelsa.86.t:0 "New Tanks have been tested!"
 ne_skelsa.86.d:0 "While the Red Army is equipped with tens of thousands of tanks, most are just older T-26 or BT-5. In the Spanish Civil War they were tested in real combat and this was when our general staff realized that we have to invest heavily in new designs and models. Back in 1937 we tasked various scientists and tank designers, including Mikhail Koshkin, with developing new state-of-the-art tanks which should defeat any enemy they face.\nYesterday, after several prototypes and countless tests our designers have finally presented their latest blueprints. Both tank models, one being a medium tank and the other one a heavy, can be mass-produced, are easy to maintain and feature good armor, mobility and firepower. Model "T-34", which came out of the "A-32" prototype, has a sloped armor up to 45 mm thick, uses a 76 mm gun and two MGs and can reach a top speed of 53 km/h. Our new heavy tank, the "Kliment Voroshilov 1", ot "KV-1" is with 35 km/h slower, but has a front armor of 75 mm while using the same gun as the "T-34". It already came out last year but our tank designers made some significant improvements.\nMost tests have shown good results in the combat effectiveness but it's still unknown how well the new tanks will perform against a real enemy. While being superior in most aspects compared to German, French or British tanks, they still lack radios and the optics could be better. Additionally, several conservative elements in our government have voiced their concerns about the "T-34", criticizing the high production cost. Nevertheless, the tank plants "Kirov" and "Komintern Locomotive Factory" have already begun the production and delivered some tanks to the Red Army. Several other tank factories, like "Red October", have also announced to begin mass-production. Due to the vast amount of Soviet tank corps it will probably take some years to fully modernize them."
 ne_skelsa.86.a:0 "The true defenders of our Motherland!"
 
 ##HISTORICAL FIXES END
 
 ##Brother Hao
 ne_skelsa.1.t:0 "Brother Hao wants to join the PLA"
 ne_skelsa.1.d:0 "One of our most famous singers, Brother Hao, has just asked us to join our glorious army as a corps commander. His talent to sing our revolutionary songs will inspire our soldiers to fight harder and terrify the enemy at the same time! Chairman, let's grant this Nigerian man his wish!"
 ne_skelsa.1.a:0 "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China!"
 
 
 ##WW2 Victim
 ne_skelsa.2.t:0 "The Fascists have declared War on Us!"
 ne_skelsa.2.d:0 "The vile fascists have decided to attack our beautiful and proud country! We have to resist at all costs!"
 ne_skelsa.2.a:0 "Our darkest hour..."
 
 ##Lease of Finnish Port
 ne_fin_harbor.1.t:0 "Lease of Finnish Ports"
 ne_fin_harbor.1.d:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are allowed to use Finnish ports as a military leasehold. The naval ports of Hanko and Porkalla located on the Gulf of Finland seem suited enough to support our Baltic Fleet and thus extend our range in the Baltic Sea.\nNo matter which port we choose, the lease contract, which all parties agreed on, will expire in 30 years and then the port will be Finnish again. Most of our experts predict that Hanko might be the best choice but of course they will accept your final decision."
 ne_fin_harbor.1.a:0 "Hanko is our choice."
 ne_fin_harbor.1.b:0 "Let's decide for Porkalla!"
 ne_fin_harbor.1.c:0 "Why not both?"
 ne_fin_harbor.1.e:0 "We have acquired enough territory already."
 ##Finland: Info-Event about lost ports
 ne_fin_harbor.2.t:0 "Soviets lease a naval base"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.t1:0 "The USSR demands the lease of Hanko Peninsula"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.t2:0 "The USSR demands the lease of Porkalla Peninsula"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.t3:0 "The USSR demands the lease of Hanko and Porkalla"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.t4:0 "The Soviets are not interested in our ports!"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d1:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using the peninsula near Hanko as a new base for the Red Fleet. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our port back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d2:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using the peninsula near Porkalla as a new base for the Red Fleet. Even though we hoped that they would decide for the Hanko peninsula as Porkalla is just right next to Helsinki, we have no choice but to accept this decision. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our port back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d3:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using both naval bases, Hanko and Porkalla, for the Red Fleet. The message from the Kremlin has caused heated debates among our politicians and people have already protested on the streets, but unfortunately we have no choice but to accept this decision. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our ports back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d4:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. However, the Soviet government has just announced to drop this plan and now they're not interested anymore in a lease contract. Exact reasons for this decision are still unknown but it's probably a gesture of friendship towards us.\nEen though Finland lost a lot of valuable territory, we still get to keep our ports."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.a:0 "Let's hope that they keep their word..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.b:0 "Damn imperialists!"
 ne_fin_harbor.2.c:0 "This was a surprising move."

 ne_finland.13.a:0 "Let's occupy Lapland for now"
 ne_finland.13.b:0 "We don't need to."
 
 ##Oppress the Baltic States - Info-Event
 ne_skelsa.59.t:0 "BPWE: Info regarding the Annexation of the Baltic States"
 ne_skelsa.59.d:0 "Better Post-War Europe changes the mechanic concerning the annexation of Lithunia, Latvia and Estonia. Instead of justifying on them like in vanilla you need to finish the next focus and be in the year 1940 to get an event chain for the annexation after some days. Don't waste your pp on justifying, okay?"
 ne_skelsa.59.a:0 "I understand."
 

 ##Oppress the Baltic States
 ne_skelsa.60.t:0 "Soviet Bases in the Baltic States"
 ne_skelsa.60.d:0 "Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, also known as the Baltic States, are broken shards from the Russian Empire still not reunited with us. Their independence will never be justified and we need to bring them into our fold before it's too late! While a direct annexation or invasion might be considered aggressive by other foreign powers, the Politburo came up with an idea to slowly subjugate the three nations. In the end we will replace their governments and this will lead to their integration into our motherland. Let's start by demanding military bases and access. Either they accept or our tanks will cross the border! Considering our military power we can expect our goal soon - no matter which option is chosen."
 ne_skelsa.60.a:0 "Soon they will be ours again!"
 ne_skelsa.60.b:0 "Slowly subjugate? This will take too long!"
 
 ne_skelsa.61.t:0 "The Soviet Union demands Basing Rights!"
 ne_skelsa.61.d:0 "The Soviet ambassadors arrived today in our capital with an ultimatum for us. Allegedly to combat the fascist threat, they want the right to station their troops in our country and get ownership of some of our military bases.\nAccording to foreign press, the two other Baltic nations are facing the same question right now too. Agreeing to these demands could probably satisfy [SOV.GetLeader] for now but it's very likely the Reds will return with even more demands, some of which may threaten our sovereignty! However, declining their ultimatum might be our certain end.\nWhat should we do?"
 ne_skelsa.61.a:0 "We have to submit..."
 ne_skelsa.61.b:0 "No way!"
 
 ne_skelsa.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepted our Demands!"
 ne_skelsa.62.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has complied to our demands, stating that it will serve both countries interests. We are now free to move our troops through their land.\nIn about a month, the next phase in our subjugation of the Baltic states will happen. Their fate is already sealed..."
 ne_skelsa.62.a:0 "Very good..."
 
 ne_skelsa.63.t:0 "[From.GetName] refused our Demands?!"
 ne_skelsa.63.d:0 "Our ambassadors from [From.GetCapital] just returned and told us that the government of [From.GetName] would never agree to these kinds of demands, stating that the country's sovereignty is in danger.\n\nApparently we need to solve this the hard way..."
 ne_skelsa.63.a:0 "Their stupidity will cost blood!"
 
 ne_skelsa.64.t:0 "Occupation of the Baltic States"
 ne_skelsa.64.d:0 "The Baltics have already sealed their fate when we got their military access. Now the time has come to finally occupy them! Due to their weak military we will be in Kaunas, Riga and Talinn in a couple of days and our military experts predict that there will be as good as no resistance."
 ne_skelsa.64.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
 
 ne_skelsa.65.t:0 "Soviet troops amassing near our Border!"
 ne_skelsa.65.d:0 "Our forward observers along the border report the deployment of Soviet infantry and tank batallions along the border while their troops in our country stay in the barracks! It might be a show of power or worse, a preparation of an invasion! We don#t know it yet but it's best to keep an eye on this..."
 ne_skelsa.65.a:0 "Reinforce our border imediately!"
 
 ne_skelsa.66.t:0 "Collapse of our Nation!"
 ne_skelsa.66.d:0 "We fell for the trap! How could we even have a little bit in trust in those Bolshevik bastards?\nMost important cities are occupied and the last airports are being captured! Our government has to leave the country at all costs now before it's too late. [Root.GetName] might be in Soviet hands now, but this occupation will not last forever!"
 ne_skelsa.66.a:0 "We will return someday..."
 
 ne_skelsa.67.t:0 "Collapse of [From.GetName]!"
 ne_skelsa.67.d:0 "Like expected, this tiny nation could not withstand the might of the Soviet Union! Phase 3 of our plans will place some of our most loyal ministers into their government to replace the old one. A plebiscite will be then held in about a month to formally join the USSR.\nWe could also capture the presidents of Estonia and Latvia. They're in Siberia, for now."
 ne_skelsa.67.a:0 "Set up the puppet government!"
 
 ne_skelsa.68.t:0 "Plebiscite to join the Soviet Union"
 ne_skelsa.68.d:0 "We are a small socialist nation but while our army and the will of our people is strong, the fascist menace in Europe called Germany is a real concern. Luckily, our Soviet friend can offer us the protection we need. We will hold a plebiscite to confirm this decision by our people. And we might want to correct the results a little in case the referendum will fail. Our population might not know a lot about the danger of the fascism as we do..."
 ne_skelsa.68.a:0 "As an SSR we will be stronger!"
 
 ne_skelsa.69.t:0 "Plebiscite a success in [From.GetName]!"
 ne_skelsa.69.d:0 "Exciting news from [From.GetCapital] as an overwhelming majority of the people voted to reunite with the Motherland! Our troops were greeted in all major cities of [From.GetName] and the NKVD can now start to detain any fascists they find.\nThis is another glorious day in the history of our nation!"
 ne_skelsa.69.a:0 "Completely surprising news!"
 ne_skelsa.69.a:0 "We welcome them!"
 ne_skelsa.69.b:0 "They should stay our puppet."

 ne_misc.12.d:0 "Our regular army may have surrendered but the will of our people to resist the German tyranny lives on. Several partisan groups were formed and are actively sabotaging railways, supply depots and bridges.\nEspecially the communist partisan forces are known for their effectiveness and several smaller regions are temporarily liberated by them. However, the KPJ's popularity is growing rapidly and chances are high that our government in exile may be unwelcome once the war is over..."
 ne_misc.12.a:0 "We will never surrender!"
 ne_misc.13.t:0 "A Socialist Republic"
 ne_misc.13.d:0 "We have successfully chased the fascist invaders from our country and established a socialist federal republic in our beloved country. While the world is now divided between East and West, we do not want to take a side. For now, Marshall Tito will lead the nation to a better future, devoid of war, corruption, poverty or hunger.\nWhile our country is still in ruins, rebuilding has already taken place. We have so much to do but there's no doubt we can do it!"

 ne_skelsa.200.d:0 "Like we agreed in our non-aggression pact with the Germans, we are obliged to attack Poland some time after the German invasion. Even though the Wehrmacht has effectively destroyed the Polish Army and is advancing towards Warsaw, our help could end Poland quicker.\nWe finally have the opportunity to reclaim our lost lands from 1920 and reverse our disastrous defeat against Piłsudski once and for all! Even if we don’t capture much territory, the new border between our nation and the Reich is already determined and it’s highly unlikely that the Nazis would not comply.\nOur media will simply portray the invasion as an act to protect our minorities in the region. France and the United Kingdom already have their hands full and a war is thus very unlikely..."
 ne_skelsa.200.a:0 "Finally we can revenge 1920!"
 ne_skelsa.200.b:0 "Why waste soldiers when we will get Eastern Poland anyways?"

 ##English reaction
 ne_skelsa.204.t:0 "The Soviets are attacking Poland!"
 ne_skelsa.204.d:0 "The Polish intelligence could confirm that the Red Army is indeed invading the eastern parts of Poland and has already taken several cities. With the rapid advance of the Germans and now a new front on the eastern border, we're afraid to say that the situation for our Polish friends is indeed very grim. Our military experts predict that the nation will be fully occupied in about two to four weeks.\nSeveral of our politicians are calling for a declaration of war against the Russians as well but considering the consequences it will have, this could be suicide."
 ne_skelsa.204.a:0 "Poland is lost!"

 ##Battle of Berlin## --> Two versions: Garrison unprepared and prepared
 ##Prepared
 ne_news.22.t:0 "West-Berlin Garrison has surrendered!"
 ne_news.22.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. While several American and British commanders expected the enclave to fall within a day, the West German, British, French and American divisions, some the size of brigades, offered heavy resistance and could delay the Eastern Bloc forces longer than initially expected. Thanks to several recon units who reported a build up of troops outside of the enclave, the units of W. Berlin were already on high alert. Nevertheless, the sheer amount of enemy forces forced them to abandon several positions like the Moltke Bridge early on.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite the rest of Germany once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

 ##Unprepared
 ne_news.23.t:0 "West-Berlin Garrison has surrendered!"
 ne_news.23.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. Due to the sheer mass of Communist forces, no preparation and the element of surprise on the Soviet side, several American and British commanders were shocked as they heard that most divisions in Berlin, mostly West German, British, French and American, offered no to little resistance and surrendered in mere hours. According to some eyewitnesses, the wall seperating the two Berlins was blown up after an intense air and artillery bombardment. While the loss of West Berlin was in a way unavoidable, it is still a huge blow to the West.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

 ##Berlin Wall
 ne_news.24.t:0 "The Berlin Wall is finished!"
 ne_news.24.d:0 "East German soldiers laid down more than 30 miles of barbed wire barrier through the heart of Berlin. East Berlin citizens were forbidden to pass into West Berlin, and the number of checkpoints in which Westerners could cross the border was drastically reduced. The West, taken by surprise, threatened a trade embargo against East Germany as a retaliatory measure. The Soviets responded that such an embargo be answered with a new land blockade of West Berlin. When it became evident that the West was not going to take any major action to protest the closing, East German authorities became emboldened, closing off more and more checkpoints between East and West Berlin. On August 15, they began replacing barbed wire with concrete. The wall, East German authorities declared, would protect their citizens from the pernicious influence of decadent capitalist culture."
 ne_news.24.a:0 "We will protect the inhabitants of Berlin from the influence of Western capitalism!"

 ##Soviets enter German soil
 ne_news.27.t:0 "Red Army enters German soil"
 ne_news.27.d:0 "After several years of brutal fighting in the East, numerous bloody battles and staggering losses, Soviet forces have finally entered German territory for the first time since the start of the war. While several territories annexed by Germany during the war were already captured, this time the Soviets entered the borders of Germany from 1937.\nWhile this marks an important step towards Germany’s defeat, many atrocities committed by soldiers of the Red Army have already taken place against German civilians. Cases such as rape, looting and the destruction of houses as revenge for German atrocities are becoming more common. Stavka has not yet made a statement concerning this but it’s very likely that these crimes will not go unpunished in the future."
 ne_news.27.a:0 "Next stop: Berlin!"

 ##Poland collapses (LOC needs a redo)
 ne_news.46.t:0 "Poland collapses!"
 ne_news.46.d:0 "[POL.GetLeader]has announced in a radio broadcast that, despite the massive sacrifice of the Polish people, it could no longer withstand the combined might of the German and Soviet armies. While some smaller pockets of resistance are still fighting against the occupiers it's expected that they won't last until the end of the week.\nAccording to Romanian sources, about 120000 troops could escape via the "Romanian Bridgehead" to join the British and French armies in the West to continue the fight against Nazi Germany. Additionally, the treasury of the National Bank of Poland could be evacuated there.\nWhile the war will continue in the West, many Poles feel betrayed by the Western powers, claiming that a French offensive might have stopped the Germans. Most experts are convinced that Germany, now turning to Paris, will have enormous difficulties penetrating French defenses like the Maginot Line. However, this remains to be seen."
 ne_news.46.a:0 "Disgusting..."
 ne_news.46.b:0 "And again Poland vanishes from Europe..."
 ne_news.46.c:0 "The mistakes of 1920 are undone!"
 ne_news.46.e:0 "This nation had no place in history anyways."
