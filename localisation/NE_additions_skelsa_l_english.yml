 ##Lease of Finnish Port

 ne_fin_harbor.1.d:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are allowed to use Finnish ports as a military leasehold. The naval ports of Hanko and Porkalla located on the Gulf of Finland seem suited enough to support our Baltic Fleet and thus extend our range in the Baltic Sea.\nNo matter which port we choose, the lease contract, which all parties agreed on, will expire in 30 years and then the port will be Finnish again. Most of our experts predict that Hanko might be the best choice but of course they will accept your final decision."

We will hopefully get our port back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d2:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using the peninsula near Porkalla as a new base for the Red Fleet. Even though we hoped that they would decide for the Hanko peninsula as Porkalla is just right next to Helsinki, we have no choice but to accept this decision. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our port back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d3:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. The Soviet government has just announced their interest in using both naval bases, Hanko and Porkalla, for the Red Fleet. The message from the Kremlin has caused heated debates among our politicians and people have already protested on the streets, but unfortunately we have no choice but to accept this decision. Our military has already cleared the area and civilians have been evacuated. We will hopefully get our ports back in 30 years after the contract has expired..."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.d4:0 "According to the Moscow Peace Treaty, we are forced to lease a port of their choice as a naval base to the USSR. However, the Soviet government has just announced to drop this plan and now they're not interested anymore in a lease contract. Exact reasons for this decision are still unknown but it's probably a gesture of friendship towards us.\nEen though Finland lost a lot of valuable territory, we still get to keep our ports."
 ne_fin_harbor.2.a:0 "Let's hope that they keep their word..."

 ne_news.22.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. While several American and British commanders expected the enclave to fall within a day, the West German, British, French and American divisions, some the size of brigades, offered heavy resistance and could delay the Eastern forces longer than initially expected. Thanks to several recon units who reported a build up of troops outside of West Berlin, the units of W. Berlin were already on high alert. Nevertheless, the mass of Soviet forces forced them to abandon several poistions like the Moltke Bridge early on.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

 ne_news.23.d:0 "The garrison of West Berlin surrendered this morning after a heavy air bombardment and tank assault of East German, Polish and Soviet forces. Due to the sheer mass of Communist forces, no preparation and the element of surprise on the Soviet side, several American and British commanders were shocked as they heard that most divisions in Berlin, mostly West German, British, French and American, offered no to little resistance and surrendered in mere hours. According to some eyewitnesses, the wall seperating the two Berlins was blown up after an intense air and artillery bombardment. While the loss of West Berlin was in a way unavoidable, it is still a huge blow to the West.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."
