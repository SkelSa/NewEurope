While several American and British commanders expected the enclave to fall within a day, the West German, British, French and American divisions, some the size of brigades, offered heavy resistance and could delay the Eastern forces longer than initially expected. Thanks to several recon units who reported a build up of troops outside of West Berlin, the units of W. Berlin were already on high alert. Nevertheless, the mass of Soviet forces forced them to abandon several poistions like the Moltke Bridge early on.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

According to some eyewitnesses, the wall seperating the two Berlins was blown up after an intense air and artillery bombardment. While the loss of West Berlin was in a way unavoidable, it is still a huge blow to the West.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."
