 ne_settings.4.d:0 "With the options below you can create an own faction for Japan but also enable stricter join rules for NATO or the Warsaw Pact. I highly recommend to create the "Co-Properity Sphere" as this helps the Axis AI immensely. Additionally, Japan will not join the war against the USSR when Germany does.\nThe stricter rules for NATO/WP mean that not every democratic country can join NATO, for instance, instantly. Instead, they would have to achieve a lot of party popularity. Several national spirits help you to see when a country would be ready to join. If they are a great power, Players can invite some countries earlier into their faction via the diplomacy slots while any AI-only faction requires any potential new members to have a really high party popularity among some other minor conditions. Historical invitations are done via event however.\nChoose now what you want."

While several American and British commanders expected the enclave to fall within a day, the West German, British, French and American divisions, some the size of brigades, offered heavy resistance and could delay the Eastern forces longer than initially expected. Thanks to several recon units who reported a build up of troops outside of West Berlin, the units of W. Berlin were already on high alert. Nevertheless, the mass of Soviet forces forced them to abandon several poistions like the Moltke Bridge early on.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."

Due to the sheer mass of Communist forces, no preparation and the element of surprise on the Soviet side, several American and British commanders were shocked as they heard that most divisions in Berlin, mostly West German, British, French and American, offered no to little resistance and surrendered in mere hours. According to some eyewitnesses, the wall seperating the two Berlins was blown up after an intense air and artillery bombardment. While the loss of West Berlin was in a way unavoidable, it is still a huge blow to the West.\nSome buildings like the Reichstag were heavily damaged but most of the city could escape the destruction.\n[SOV.GetLeader] announced to reunite Berlin once and for all and said that "Soviet tanks won't stop until they reached the Atlantic"."
