 ##Stalin's Death
 ne_news.19.t:0 "Joseph Stalin died"
 ne_news.19.d:0 "Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union since 1924, died in Moscow. Like his right-wing counterpart, Hitler, who was born in Austria, Joseph Stalin was not a native of the country he ruled with an iron fist. Isoeb Dzhugashvili was born in 1889 in Georgia, then part of the old Russian empire. The son of a drunk who beat him mercilessly and a pious washerwoman mother, Stalin learned Russian, which he spoke with a heavy accent all his life, in an Orthodox Church-run school. While studying to be a priest at Tiflis Theological Seminary, he began secretly reading Karl Marx and other left-wing revolutionary thinkers. The “official” communist story is that he was expelled from the seminary for this intellectual rebellion; in reality, it may have been because of poor health."
 ne_news.19.a:0 "This is a huge mourning for our entire socialist camp!"
 ne_news.19.b:0 "Russians mourn for the man who killed millions of his own people..."
 ne_news.19.c:0 "We hope that this will discharge the tense situation in the world"
