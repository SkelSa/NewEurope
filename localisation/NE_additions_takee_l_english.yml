 ##Stalin's Death
 ne_news.19.t:0 "Joseph Stalin is dead!"
 ne_news.19.d:0 "Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union since 1924, died in Moscow. Like his right-wing counterpart, Hitler, who was born in Austria, Joseph Stalin was not a native of the country he ruled with an iron fist. Isoeb Dzhugashvili was born in 1889 in Georgia, then part of the old Russian empire. The son of a drunk who beat him mercilessly and a pious washerwoman mother, Stalin learned Russian, which he spoke with a heavy accent all his life, in an Orthodox Church-run school. While studying to be a priest at Tiflis Theological Seminary, he began secretly reading Karl Marx and other left-wing revolutionary thinkers. The “official” communist story is that he was expelled from the seminary for this intellectual rebellion; in reality, it may have been because of poor health."

 ##Description for both Chinese; BPWE needs it's own better loc for CHI and PRC
 ##CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kuomintang regime under Chiang Kai-shek was at the peak of its power, having driven Mao Tse-tung's Communists on their grueling 6,000 mile march to Shaanxi and established themselves as the most powerful force in Chinese politics. It seemed that China was at last united under a stable, modernizing regime, ready to bring the country into the 20th century after years of humiliation at the hands of stronger countries. However, it faced a severe challenge: an increasingly belligerent and imperialist Japan desiring to expand its resource base at China's expense. Having already conceded control of Manchuria to the Japanese in 1931, China seems destined for further clashes with the island nation, yet in early 1936 Chiang shows no signs of letting up in his civil war against the Communists. The question China must now face is a sore one: when and if Japan continues her expansion, will the Nationalists fight, or will China be humiliated yet again?"
 #CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlord rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 #PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
