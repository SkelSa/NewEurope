 ##Intro for Mod
 nenews.1.t:0 "Better Post-War Europe"
 nenews.1.d:0 "Hi and thanks for subscribing to my mod. BPWE enhances and guarantees a more realistic Europe in a historical playthrough. Besides some fixes like flags and names, this mod also adds around 30 various states so you can recreate the borders of Europe after the Nazi defeat. \n Additionally I've included several events to correct any bordergore and some other tweaks. Most events are now dynamic, though the old ones (event neweurope.1 -neweurope.7) are still in and have to be triggered by console.\n My event are optional, you can always click them away and let horrible borders haunt you. Nevertheless some Chinese events will be in the hands of the AI. \n And now have fun, I've already talked too much..."
 nenews.1.a:0 "Thanks for the info!"
 ##PRC-Proclamation
 nenews.2.t:0 "The Proclamation of the PRC"
 nenews.2.d:0 "Today Mao Zedong, Chairman of the PRC, announced the official founding of the People's Republic of China. After several years of heavy fighting against the Kuomintang and the horrible Second Sino-Japanese War, peace has finally returned to the nation and rebuilding is now in progress. While millions of families bury their dead loved ones, Chairman Mao has promised his people a prosperous future and a new era for China, with the principles of equality, justice and socialism.\n While this development will surely influence the politics of China's neighbours, it's still a question how and where Mao Zedong will lead his nation. "
 nenews.2.a:0 "After decades, China has been united again!"
 nenews.2.b:0 "We have to intervene or Asia will be red too!"
 nenews.2.c:0 "The revolution has spread to Asia..."
 ##Hitler is dead!
 nenews.3.t:0 "Hitler is Dead!"
 nenews.3.d:0 "Just now, Karl Dönitz announced in an important broadcast that the Führer, Adolf Hitler, "died defending his Vaterland" and he himself ,Dönitz, is now in command of the remains of the Reich. There wasn't much information else, however it's assumed that Hitler comitted suicide in his bunker in Berlin to avoid captivity by the enemy surrounding the Reichshauptstadt. The whereabouts of the other NSDAP politicians or Eva Braun is unknown, though it is assumed they're either dead or fleeing. \n Since most of the Reich is occupied and the Wehrmacht is near collapse, the death of Hitler is probably the last nail to the coffin of German morale. "
 nenews.3.a:0 "The 1000-year Reich will fall!"
 nenews.3.b:0 "May he burn in hell!"
 nenews.3.c:0 "So the bastard's dead? Too bad we didn't catch him alive!"
 nenews.3.e:0 "We will never forget you and win this war! Ruhe in Frieden, ewiger Führer!"
 ##Hitler is in RAGE!
 nenews.4.t:0 "Hitler is in RAGE!"
 nenews.4.d:0 "Several reports coming from the Führerbunker indicate that the Führer went completely insane. Allegedly after he heard that Steiner couldn't conduct an offensive to relieve Berlin, Hitler became enraged. Shortly afterwards the Führer accused everyone, even the German people, as cowards and traitors and broke pencils while shouting for Fegelein, who will be executed as a traitor when found. Several German generals are convinced that Adolf Hitler has really lost any contact with the reality and still commands around divisions which no longer exist. It's just a matter of time now until his Reich will collapse and the Allies find him."
 nenews.4.a:0 "Crazy!"
 nenews.4.b:0 "You could say he...is...Führious!"
 nenews.4.c:0 "His days are numbered. We need to catch him!"
 nenews.4.e:0 "This is just temporary..."
 ##POSSIBLE NEWS EVENT IDEAS: Division of Germany (East/West), Division of Japan (North/South), Unification of Germany/ Denial of German reunification, Unification of Japan, Founding of NATO/WP, Hatay, NFL to Canada (Begin Korea War)

 prc.1.t:0 "PRC asks to integrate us"
 prc.1.d:0 "After the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, Mao has just today issued an offer to us. We should become part of the PRC and share the glory of Chinese Socialism or face dire consequences. What should we do?"
 prc.1.a:0 "We will join them of course! Long live Chairman Mao!"
 prc.1.b:0 "How dare they even disrespect our sovereignty!"
 prc.2.t:0 "Proclaimation of the People's Republic of China"

 prc.4.d:0 "Sheng Shicai today announced that his country will never be a part of our new China and thus declined our generous offer. What should we do? "

 prc.5.t:0 "PRC asks to annex us"
 prc.5.d:0 "The nationalist Chinese have been defeated and Mao now looks to reintegrate our country into theirs. Doing so would bring us an uncertain future, but resisting will probably end up worse. What is our plan?"
 prc.5.a:0 "We have no chance. Resistance is useless..."
 prc.5.b:0 "They will never enter Tibetan soil! Prpare the guns, WE'RE going to war!"
 prc.6.t:0 "Tibet folds"
 prc.6.d:0 "The government of Tibet has announced that they bow to our ultimatum and will from now on be part of our glorious Republic!"
 prc.6.a:0 "The Tibetans will not regret their decision!"
 prc.7.t:0 "Tibet refuses"
 prc.7.d:0 "These foolish Tibetans have dared to resist our generous offer. Should we bring them into our People's Republic by declaring war or has there already been enough bloodshed? "
 prc.7.a:0 "They won't even have rocks to throw at us!"
 prc.7.b:0 "War is unnecessary, friendly relations are also valuable"
 prc.8.t:0 "Integrating Tibet and Sinkiang"
 prc.8.d:0 "With the defeat of Chiang Kai-Shek's China, Sinkiang and Tibet now stand alone, while being unprotected from foreign powers.

 prc.8.a:0 "Only East Turkestan is interesting for us"
 prc.8.b:0 "We need access to the Himalayas"
 prc.8.c:0 "Send our ambassadors to both countries!"
 prc.8.e:0 "Let them stay independent"
 prc.9.t:0 "The Lease of Port Arthur/Dalian"
 prc.9.d:0 "Warm water ports are very valuable for the Soviet Union as most of our ports freeze during the winter and in conclusion hinder our trade. Though we do have the Baltic ports and Königsberg now with Germany's defeat, we still lack a proper harbor in the East Asia, as Vladivostok occasionally freezes too. The Chinese under Mao control Port Arthur, which we lost in 1904 when the Japanese attacked us.\nOur communist brothers in China would surely lease us this port, right? "
 prc.9.a:0 "Send a request to Mao!"
 prc.9.b:0 "We don't need Dalian to be honest..."
 prc.10.t:0 "The USSR wants to lease Dalian"
 prc.10.d:0 "The Soviets recently sent us a request to lease Port Arthur, also known as Dalian, from us. They want to have it for approximately 10 years to maintain a warm water port. Do we agree on this issue? "
 prc.10.a:0 "They've helped us to fight the Nationalists, sure!"
 prc.10.b:0 "No, we had enough of colonialism"
 prc.11.t:0 "The Chinese have accepted!"
 prc.11.d:0 "Chairman Mao Zedong has announced to agree our bid for a lease of Port Arthur. In 10 years it is theirs again..."
 prc.11.a:0 "Long live the People's Republic!"
 prc.12.t:0 "Mao won't give us Port Arthur!"
 prc.12.d:0 "Our ambassadors, who returned from Beijing, told us that the CPC won't let us lend Dalian from them. From now on, Vladivostok has to suffice..."
 prc.12.a:0 "Damn the Chinese!"
 prc.13.t:0 "Pressing for Dalian"
 prc.13.d:0 "A foreign power occupies rightful Chinese territory and now the time has come to end colonialism once and for all. Empires belong to the past and it's our duty to reunite all Chinese citizens into the People's Republic. Send an ultimatum to the occupier of Dalian and force them to leave!"
 prc.13.a:0 "They will gladly return it to us!"
 prc.13.b:0 "They can have it, we don't need anymore bloodshed..."
 prc.14.t:0 "The PRC wants to have Port Arthur back!"
 prc.14.d:0 "Chinese officials have just sent an ultimatum to us citing that they are the rightful owners of Dalian and thus we should cede the harbor to Mao for once and for all. What is our answer?"
 prc.14.a:0 "We have better ports, let's return Dalian"
 prc.14.b:0 "This harbour is too important for us!"
 prc.15.t:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted our ultimatum for Dalian"
 prc.15.d:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted and returned rightful Chinese clay."
 prc.15.a:0 "Long live the CPC!"
 prc.16.t:0 "[From.GetName] has declined our ultimatum for Dalian"
 prc.16.d:0 "Our ambassadors, who returned from [From.GetCapital], told us that the current occupier won't return Dalian voluntarily. This is outrageous!..."
 prc.16.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
 prc.16.b:0 "We have better things to do. Back down"
 ##return of Port Arthur to China
 prc.17.t:0 "The Return of Port Arthur"
 prc.17.d:0 "Ten years ago, we leased Port Arthur, also known as Dalian from the Chinese to relieve Vladivostok. Now the Chinese demand the return since the contract has now expired and their military demands a vital port back. We can either return it, like we promised, or keep it under military control. It would be foolish for them to attack us, but we might lose our good relationship with the CPC. "
 prc.17.a:0 "A promise is a promise!"
 prc.17.b:0 "Port Arthur will be Russian from now on. Forever!"
 prc.18.t:0 "[From.GetName] returns Dalian!
 prc.18.d:0 "After ten years of leasing, Dalian is finally again Chinese and will be for the next centuries! [From.GetName] has kept its promises from the contract and returned the harbor yesterday though several facilities, which were built during the time, were disassembled and brought back to [From.GetNameDef].\n Nevertheless the [From.GetAdjective] government proved to be trustworthy and there will surely be more trade and cooperation in the future!"
 prc.18.a:0 "Dalian is ours again!"
 prc.19.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects the return of Dalian!"
 prc.19.d:0 "Ten years ago, we leased the vital warm water port Dalian, or Port Arthur, to [From.GetNamedef]. According to the contract we should've had control over it since the end of last month but [From.GetName]'s warships are still there and they refuse to acknowledge our agreement. It seems like our socialist neighbor has fooled us and appparently only war can settle this dispute now. Is an armed conflict between our nations really the only choice? "
 prc.19.a:0 "Dalian belongs to us!"
 prc.19.b:0 "We can't afford a war right now..."
 ##PRC wants Mengukuo and manshukuo (?) and East Hebei
 prc.20.t:0 "Demanding former Japanese territories"
 prc.20.d:0 "Manchukuo, Mengjiang and East Hebei were all lost during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1931. Though Japan is now defeated, another nation could take control over them during the peace treaties and now several million Chinese people are again trapped under a foreign regime. As the one and true China, it's our job to unify all Chinese citizens under one flag.\nThe time has come to end foreign administration; let's send some written requests to get our territory back!"
 prc.20.a:0 "We've waited for far too long!"
 prc.20.b:0 "We might get drawn into a war..."
 prc.21.t:0 "Mao Zedong demands Chinese land!"
 prc.21.d:0 "Since the defeat of Japan and the countless peace conferences following we've managed to take control over Manschuria and Menjiang and thus secure a foothold in East Asia. Unfortunately the people are not exactly happy over our rule there and just shortly the People's Republic of China has issued claims over territories they lost against the Japanese. Most of our ministers support to return Manschuria but actually doing this would end our presence on the Yellow Sea. Diplomatically seen, this could actually prove to be a chance of a new ally, be it in trading or alliances..."
 prc.21.a:0 "China is right; we have no reason to be there"
 prc.21.b:0 "We've fought hard for it. Never!"
 prc.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] ceded Manschuria"
 prc.22.d:0 "Yesterday [From.GetName] announced to return the former japanese puppets Manchukuo, Mengjiang and East Hebei. While they will lose some bases and access to most of East Asia, [From.GetName] agreed that reuniting people has priority over securing a presence around the globe."
 prc.22.a:0 "So sweet!"
 prc.23.t:0 "[From.GetName] will keep their puppets"
 prc.23.d:0 "Though we made several efforts to convince the foreign government to reunite China with its people [From.GetNameDef] refused our ultimatum, citing that East Asia is too strategically important and thousands of [From.GetAdjective] soldiers died retaking it.\nMilitary force is apparently our only option to free our people..."
 prc.23.a:0 "Redeploy the PLA, we're going to WAR!"
 prc.23.b:0 "We're too weak against [From.GetNameDef]"

As a neutral buffer zone, Germany has no chance now to attack its neighbors and our tanks won't face the enemy ones anymore every minute! Of course the German people would be reunited.\nThere's just one problem: What if the Americans try to influence this neutral Germany into their zone.

 ###Not implemented yet: Korea division, when global flag korea_partitioned  USA asks -> USSR can decline or accept, when declining: remove previous option and try again
 nepart.19.t:0 "The Fate of Korea"
 nepart.19.d:0 "Korea, a Japanese colony since 1910, is finally liberated and can now emerge as an own nation to serve their people. There's just a small problem: Both the USSR and USA control the North and South respectively and while the Reds want to see a  striving socialist nation, the Americans would rather have an ally in Asia to stop the spread of communism. To find a suitable solution we may have to divide the peninsula since both parties fought hard to regain their chunk of land..."
