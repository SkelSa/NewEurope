Here are some formalities for Modding now: 
- Decision Category files will have the format "CAT_DEC_NE_countryname". 
- Decision files will be "DEC_NE_countryname". Event files, as usual NewEurope_countryname.
- More will be added over time

And always put events/decisions to their corresponding country file. There are still some left overs, like NewEurope_EasternBloc or so. They will be reduced over time.
