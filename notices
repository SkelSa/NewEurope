Here are some formalities for Modding now: 
- Decision Category files will have the format "CAT_DEC_NE_countryname". 
- Decision files will be "DEC_NE_countryname". Event files, as usual NewEurope_countryname.
- More will be added over time

And always put events/decisions to their corresponding country file. There are still some left overs, like NewEurope_EasternBloc or so. They will be reduced over time.

25.03.2018, Notices

I did a little test game. Here are my Notices:

- The Soviets perfectly fighting against Poland without disturbing anyone and Poland didn't call Allies in the war with the Soviets;
- Germany can't in garrisons and it suffers from naval invasions. I guess we should made something for Germany in ai_strategy;
- Some small events, like the 'The Death of Rudolf Hess' worked unhistorical for some reason;
- Still a bordergore in Yugoslavia. We definitely should fix it somehow;
- Germany does the focus against Denmark and Norway, while it at war with France or Poland;
- The Allies played really bad in Africa and the UK lost the whole Egypt;
- The Soviets had a war with Lithuania;
