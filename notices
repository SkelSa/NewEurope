####  RULES FOR MODDING  ####
#############################


- Decision Category files will have the format "CAT_DEC_NE_countryname". 
- Decision files will be "DEC_NE_countryname". Event files, as usual NewEurope_countryname.
- Portraits are named like this "Portrait_[TAG]_[leadername]"; Generals are "Portrait_[TAG]_[General/Admiral]_[leadername]"
- When doing decisions and events, they go into into the file of the country which the event/decision is ABOUT. E.g. the Newfoundland
  event chain starts with Britain but is about Canada primarily. So this event goes into NewEurope_Canada. 
- When doing events and decisions, always write in a comment above it who gets the event. E.g. ##Soviet: Annexation of the Baltics
- Always put events/decisions to their corresponding country file. There are still some left overs, like NewEurope_EasternBloc or so. They will be reduced over time.



This is a headline for most event chains:

##TEST GAME RESULTS##


I did a little test game. Here are my Notices:

- The Soviets perfectly fighting against Poland without disturbing anyone and Poland didn't call Allies in the war with the Soviets;
- Germany can't in garrisons and it suffers from naval invasions. I guess we should made something for Germany in ai_strategy;
- Some small events, like the 'The Death of Rudolf Hess' worked unhistorical for some reason;
- Still a bordergore in Yugoslavia. We definitely should fix it somehow;
- Germany does the focus against Denmark and Norway, while it at war with France or Poland;
- The Allies played really bad in Africa and the UK lost the whole Egypt;
- The Soviets had a war with Lithuania;
